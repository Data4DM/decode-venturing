so I'm David Ryan editor of Wy and it's an amazing honor to introduce Peter who has a fabulous new bestseller out um 0o to one and Peter is a busy man he has a number of lives that all run at the same time he is um managing partner of the founders fund president of the of clarium capital co-founder of PayPal of palente here um makes good Investments like $500,000 for 10.2% of a new company called Facebook in 2004 and when he tweets he only ever tweets once he gets 60,000 followers pretty much straight away now we have big expectations for this evening because everywhere Peter has spoken in the last week or so about his new book um he's generated headlines and the headlines include you know Twitter's horribly mismanaged there's a lot of pot smoking there Apple must innovate more technology stalled in 1970 The Wall Street Journal competition is for losers and I think my favorite one from Fortune Peter teal disagrees with you so I'm expecting Peter to tear apart some of my questions but first please could we welcome him and give him the stage to talk about 0 to1 thank you very much well um after after that introduction I'm I'm actually quite nervous about saying anything at all here since uh feel like I'm on being recorded and uh it may come back to haunt me in all kinds of strange ways in in in writing a book about entrepreneurship um one of the one of the uh this and teaching it came out of a class that I taught at Stanford in 2012 and one of the challenges in teaching entrepreneurship or writing about it is I think people tend to sort of write books U business books that make one of two kinds of mistakes there's one where it's sort of uh you tell all these War Stories and this be like this is what I did at PayPal in 99 this how we combined email and money and this is you know how this all worked and that's not terribly relevant to people uh who are interested in starting new businesses or or learning from that and then I think the other end of the spectrum you have uh these uh business books which I think are sort of pseudo scientific and it's like this formula and you do follow these five steps and you will have a successful company and I I think that approach also does not work for a similar reason which is that I think every moment in the history of business and the history of Technology happens only once the next Bill Gates will not be starting an operating system company the next Larry Page won't start a search engine the next Mark Zuckerberg would not be starting a social network if you are copying these people you're not learning from them uh and um um and so the the the theme of my book is that uh what's actually important is the things that make these companies singular and and different and um and you know this chapter entitled one you know this opening line from Anna coren and um it says all happy families are alike all unhappy families are unhappy in their own special way uh and I think the opposite is true of business all um all happy companies are different all um all unhappy companies are alike and that they've failed to escape the uh sameness that is competition and um and this was this the title of the chap of one of the chapters is all happy companies are different it got when the Wall Street Journal ex excerted it and uh and published it uh they uh they retitled that to competition is for losers which is a somewhat punchier way of putting that idea and um and you know I try to get at this uniqueness question through these various contrarian questions I think are are good to ask one the the business one I always is like what great company is nobody building the the more intellectual uh version of this question that I think makes for always a terrific interview question is tell me something that's true that almost nobody agrees with you on and this is a shockingly hard question for at least two different reasons uh first reason is that we've been taught that truth is conventional that truth is just simply what people agree on uh and so it automatically sounds like you have to be really brilliant and it's really hard to discover some new truth that uh is hit herto unsuspected um but it's it's also very difficult because of just the social context in which uh the these questions get asked so if uh if you're answering it and the interviewer says yes I believe that all along that's uh uh that then then that's by definition a bad answer and a good answer is one the person asking it does not agree with or does not want to hear and um and you know and it requires certain amount of courage and we live in a world which I think courage is an even shorter Supply than than genius so what I want to uh what I want to try to do in my brief comments tonight is I'm just going to give uh a few few answers my my book is just a whole series of answers to that question of things I believe to be true that uh most people don't agree with me on um but I'll I'll give three um three uh quick answers to it tonight in my in my comments and we'll uh go to the questions um so first one um uh and this is this sort of flows out of this idea that you want um all happy companies to be different and unique um most people think that capitalism and competition are synonyms I believe they are antonyms um you know a capitalist is someone who accumulates capital a world of competition is a world where all the profits are competed away and so if you're an entrepreneur or a Founder you always want to be building a monopoly you do not want to be uh doing something where you're in Cutthroat for ferocious competition a restaurant is a terrible business to go into it's super competitive and extremely non- capitalistic people never make money opening restaurants uh and uh I sort of give Google as the example of a company at the other end of the spectrum where you have enormous profits um and you've had no sort of serious competition in 12 years ever since they definitively distanced themselves from uh Yahoo and Microsoft back in 2002 and um and I think one of the things that's that these breakthrough zero to1 companies have is that they uh they they do things where uh when you when you do something new you um you are in the sort of happy place where um you're not sort of directly competing with too many people and then you have a product that you are offering the world that does not yet exist and uh and that's that's that's what makes these franchises uh so so extremely valuable um I think this question of competition and Monopoly there's sort of many different reasons it's it's it's sort of I think very underappreciated uh you know sort of there's always this Nuance where the people who have monopolies generally don't talk about it and the people um who are in perfect competition pretend that they have something special so you know if you if you're if you're running Google um your talking points are you know we're a we're not a search company but we're a technology company and we're competing ferociously with apple on the phone and with Facebook on social and Microsoft on office and we're building cars and we're competing with the car companies and we're just there's like competition everywhere and uh we're not the Monopoly the government is looking for um and then um and then if you were say trying to open a restaurant in London you would say uh you know you're trying to get investors to invest in your restaurant you will um you will say something like well this is a completely uh and and then the investors will say well I don't want to invest in a restaurant it's a bad business it'll lose money and you'll say no this is a completely different restaurant it's oneof a kind it's the only French nepes Fusion cuisine in um in London and in like uh you know South Paddington or wherever in some small area of London and um and so you will again artificially Define what you're doing in a way that's very different and so so I think this question always gets obscured by the people inside these businesses and that's why it's this very important idea that's uh much bigger than than we think it is but I think it's also um we also um get trapped in uh competitive for sort of a psychological reason it's often um we often find it reassuring to be in crowds to do things that lots of other people are doing um and um and uh you know the word ape already in the time of Shakespeare meant both primate and to imitate and there's something about human nature that's disturbingly lemong like sheeplike aplike her like um and uh and this is this is always a dangerous sort of behavior pattern when you're starting a business business because when you're in a crowd it's the crowd of people you're you're competing against uh um and you know you know I've been a sort of very big critic of uh of the uh higher education system uh because I think that sort of encapsulates this ideology of competition in its a purest form where you have to compete on you know all these sort of tests and jumping through all these hoops you get to the same sort of uh short list of elite universities in the US then you go into the same short of elite jobs and um and a lot of it gets uh gets driven by by people not really asking uh what are they doing why is it important but you know when you're focused on competition you're always focused on beating the person next to you and you do get better at the thing you're competing on like if you're on a high school swimming team you'll swim a little bit faster than you otherwise would have swam but uh you often lose sight of what's truly important and truly valuable and there sort of this autobiographical part of this book where if I had to give advice to my younger self uh um you know I was I was hypert tracked I was I was you know in 8th grade um Junior High School one of my friends wrote in my yearbook that I would surely get into Stanford in four or five years time and that's what happened and then I went to Stanford law school then I sort of got tracked into sort of a big law firm in um in Manhattan uh where from the outside everybody was trying to get in on the inside everybody was trying to leave um and um you know uh after I I left after seven months and three days uh one of the uh one of the uh one of the people down down the hall for me told me it was very reassuring to see me leave he had no idea that it was possible to escape from Alcatraz which um was of course all you had to do was go out the front door but uh but it was uh um it was again the so much of people's identity was wrapped up in winning these various competitive dynamics that they could not think about this so if I gave advice to my give advice to my younger self it would be to you know really think hard why was I doing these things was I engaging in um was I doing these things because I genuinely wanted to do them or was it simply a sort of a Prestige status game that I was playing uh which um and I think if I was honest that there was way more of that going on and there's I think a lot of that going on with a lot of us that we should always uh think hard about um about doing less of second uh second contrarian idea I'll throw out is I think the sort of a conventional view is that there are um that uh that the are not that many answers left to this question what's true that uh nobody agrees with you on we believe that all these truths have already been discovered in the past um and you know and maybe there are still some things but they're just about impossible to figure out so there are conventions that we understand there are Mysteries that nobody can figure out um but I I by contrast think there still a lot of things left on intermediate level there are a lot of things that I call Secrets which are truths that are hard but possible to to discover um and um and I think I think there is always a secret at the core of every great business there's some um some sort of research program that uh or some some area that that people are really really focused on they think about really hard and it sort of advances um their thinking to the point where they get an understanding about something that other people do not yet have you know at PayPal we were very interested in uh um um um sort of the cryptocurrency and um encryption technology and currencies and could they be intersected could you build a new digital currency this was a question that you know animated us tremendously we didn't quite succeed in building one at PayPal even though we had t-shirts that said that we're going to be the new world currency we didn't quite succeed in that in that goal but uh but that sort of a in-depth substantive Focus actually did help us think really hard about how do you architect a new payment system how do you do certain things differently and it it was was a key part of inspiring us and I think there are sort of many Secrets left and this is something um this is something we generally do not understand and it's it's it's not obvious where one should look you know if you're if you were living in the 17th or 18th century you could look at a map and there were empty spaces left on the map and you could become an Explorer and go and discover those places so there sort of a natural geographical sense in which there were Secrets left or um in the 19th century uh there were still you know places in the periodic table of elements that were empty and you could sort of do some basic chemistry and find some secrets and and there's sort of a sense that maybe geography or chemistry are fields that are you know basic chemistry and geography sort of fields that are closed but I think most fields are not like that I think most fields are still ones where there's tremendous amount of innovation possible certainly this is true in um in the uh computer field where we've seen uh massive innovation in in recent decades in the world of bits computers internet mobile internet that whole ensemble um I I think we've seen less innovation in the world of atoms um uh you know Transportation um energy clean energy biomed biotech um space travel all the kinds of things people thought about in the 50s and 60s but I think it's um I think it's not because there's some law of nature that it's hard to innovate or impossible to innovate in these areas it's just that there's sort of been this cultural change where we haven't tried as much and and we you know it's it's it's sort of there's there's a lot of this has a self-fulfilling character if if you think that you can't find a secret then you're not going to try and you will not look and you will not be a person who ever finds one and uh and uh and and uh and so failure pessimism can have a self-fulfilling character as uh conversely if you think there's a lot to be discovered um progress can accelerate and more more things can happen so second sort of uh contrarian truth that I believe to be true is that there actually are many Secrets left to be discovered third um third uh third idea and this one's maybe a little bit bigger picture I I think that uh in a uh successful 21st century this century is going to be a a a great and peaceful Century I think there are two big trends that have to continue there's a trend of globalization and a trend of technology and I think it's always important to think of these two things as very different globalization involves copying things that work horizontal growth extensive progress going from one to n um and I always draw globalization on the on the x-axis technology involves doing new things going from zero to one vertical or intensive progress I always draw it on a y- axis and I I always set up that contrast because I think there's a tendency for people to um to Define technology and globalization as synonymous and I think it's worth thinking of these as very different vectors of of of progress we um um the U the uh and if we sort of think about the last 200 years there have been many periods where we've had one or the other or both and which again underscores how they're different the 19th century you had tremendous amounts of both globalization and technological progress you had both in the 19th century 1914 after World War I starts globalization goes into reverse um and uh there's less trade the world becomes less connected you know Iron Curtain goes down parts of the world more or less are completely cut off and it doesn't really resume till uh Kissinger goes to China in 1971 and we've had the last four decades have been ferocious globalization technology has been we had a lot of progress 1914 to 71 since 71 I would argue it's been more limited and um and with a stress on on the on the computer side and so we've had a era of globalization without technology and um sorry uh technology without globalization and then globalization without technology that's characterized the last 100 years in in contrast to the century that came before um it's this ort of shift from the 50s and 60s today is in in in the way we talk about the world in the 50s or 60s you would have said that the world was divided into the first world and the third world the first world was the place where accelerating change was happening the third world was the place that was sort of permanently screwed up and broken today we speak of the developing and the developed world the developing world is that part of the world that will copy the developed world and um and it's sort of this Convergence Theory of globalization China is the epitome of it has a very straightforward plan for the next 20 years it's just going to copy everything that works in the west it'll skip a few steps but it has a very straightforward uh plan ahead of it but um this developing developed dichotomy while sort of prog globalization is also implicitly anti-technological because it tells us that we are living in the part of the world that is developed that is done that is finished where nothing new is going to happen that's stagnant where we can expect nothing to change uh where we can expect the the younger generation to um do do no better than their parents maybe worse um and um and I think this is a conception of our world that we should resist very strongly uh and um and I think we should not even accept the idea that we're living in the developed world that we're living in some sort of end of Technology era um and so I think we should um always return to this question how do we go about developing the developed world thank you very much I was going to ask you which important truth to very few people agree with you on but I think um you answer my question there's a big theme in the book a number of interviewers uh actually still ask me that even after after I gave a talk similar to this one so you paid you paid way more attention I stopped there's so much we could focus on in the book but um there's a theme that comes up repeatedly which is the value of the Monopoly business you talk about the history of progress is a history of better Monopoly businesses replacing incumbents yet if you look over the last century monopolies haven't always acted in the most enlightened way they haven't always benefited the consumer as governments would have hoped and governments have often had to come in and regulate isn't this a bit of a pure view of the value of a monopoly well um Al so there's there's always a you have to always distinguish looking at this from the inside and the outside so from the point of view of someone starting a business um from the point of view of a Founder an entrepreneur you want to always build a monopoly and it's it's it's always uh great to have one from uh from from the inside um and it gives you way more cushion you can do all sorts of things much better you can be you I think you can be a more ethical company when Google says uh don't be evil on on one level it's a marketing Ploy but on another level you can you can um you don't have to care about nothing but money in a company where you're making so much of it so um so um on the inside I I think you always want to want to have a monopoly from from the outside from the point of view of society the question are are monopolies good or bad and I think they are I agree with the critique of monopolies in a stagnant world where it's like the Parker Brothers board game and the monopolist is just a rent collector or a toll collector um but I think that if if you have a dynamic world where people are inventing and creating new things um um these are actually positive so when Apple builds a smartphone that just works it has a monopoly on the iPhone for many years and I think it still has somewhat of a monopoly in various ways today um and that's a good Monopoly because it created something that did not exist before and the sort of the Common Sense way to differentiate good from bad monopolies lines are a little bit fuzzy but the common sense way is just do consumers think it's a good thing or do they think it's a bad thing so they might think the post office is a bad government structured Monopoly uh whereas Apple uh would be would be seen as a as a good one but is it healthy for the wider economy if a single company like Facebook owns so much data on people's preferences that real-time knowledge based on what we're doing mobile and they can set the rules they're more powerful than governments well I um you know I certainly much prefer Facebook tone the data than than the government I think that um I think that uh I think I think I think I think you have to draw all these distinctions um you know it's it's uh there there there's an important debate about privacy there are important questions about um about um about how one draw these lines but I think the uh you know Facebook product has has created a lot of value in the world it's made the world more connected it's helped people stay in touch with their friends um and I think it's been a it's been enormous net plus to to people um people all over the place um you know I think um so yeah every startup in its pitch talks about it's going to come and disrupt a sector um you say in the book that disruption is a self- congratulatory buzzword for anything trendy and new uh well I I S certainly go after all these different uh all these different uh categories uh I'm I'm always skeptical of anything that gets you know used uh this much non-stop by people so uh you know the uh disruptive person in elementary school get sent to the principal's office disruptors are people who look for trouble they typically find it um you know um uh um Napster was a classically disruptive business that sought to take on the M disrupt the music industry um and you know it's uh had this disruptive name you know you what do you what do you nap you nap some music you nap a kid you it's it's uh and um and um and so there's always a sense where um um disruption already starts by thinking of itself in competitive terms where you're defining yourself against somebody and I I think you don't want to take your bearings from breaking things but rather from building things so we have to go for an entirely New Market I I I think those are the the best companies are ones that go for for uh broadly uh new markets uh you know it's certainly if you if you go after an existing Market that's where uh that's where you're going to get the most ferocious resistance the most intense competition um you know PayPal went after online payments you know visa and MasterCard were not altogether happy because it was a new market they thought they perhaps should have owned but um but it was not like we were taking away business directly from them and in some ways we were actually expanding the universal payments that they enabled and so at the end of the day they didn't come after us nearly as much as they would have had we say tried to disrupt their business in some direct way so why didn't PayPal become the default payment mechanism why didn't PayPal become Bitcoin well I think payment mechanisms and currencies are are are related but quite different uh sorts of things um so I think yeah uh PayPal set out to build a new world currency we did build a rather powerful Internet payment system um Bitcoin I think at this point is is somewhat the opposite uh it has actually created a new currency at least on the level of speculation um and the payment system part of it actually rather lacking where it's hard to act in Bitcoins people will do it for things that are illegal and they can't buy otherwise but for legal payments it's actually quite hard to do and so I think the sort of the opposite of uh set of things from from from that which PayPal had it's it's it's quite hard you know in general I think a currency is a much harder thing to build than a payment system because it requires a much larger Network effect you know it's much harder uh to buy into it um you know the uh you know when I was um I don't have it on me but you know the the prop that I would always use when I was uh a CEO at PayPal was you'd hold up a $100 bill in front of an audience and it would be like hypnotic everybody would want it and there's sort of this network effect to money it's very difficult to create a new currency because you're competing with um with an existing very large Network already there's a lot of people in the valley though putting big money into Bitcoin businesses thinking this is going to be the one are you not excited I am I am still a little bit more skeptical because they've not yet gotten the payment system part of it to work but uh but I think that's the you know if you said what would make me more bullish on bitcoin it's if there were more um more legal payments happening on it so when you meet entrepreneurs what personal characteristics do you define in those that you think are going to be the big success stories well I think um I think these um these uh zero to1 companies they're they're generally not solo efforts it's always a bit of a team effort of people working together and so you you know you want a great business idea you want a great technology you want very talented people but one of the very critical question is how well do these people actually work uh work together and um because I think I think the most common cause for failure is the people just don't get along and sort of blows up uh it blows up internally uh way before it gets destroyed externally by by comp external competition so people internally don't get along um the uh and so I question I always like to ask is the prehistory question you know how did you meet how long have you known each other all those sorts of questions bad answers are things like we met a week ago at a uh entrepreneurial networking event we both wanted to start companies and um and that's sort of like saying we got married at the slot machines in Vegas uh you might hit the jackpot probably very bad idea um the the the good answers are things like we met and we've been working for a number of years we've been friends for many years you know there's some complimentarity maybe you know one of us is focused on the technology side the other person's focused more on the business side uh so that's that's that's a good answer I don't know if you notice a correlation between very successful Tech businesses particularly coming from the valley and people with let's say limited social skills there is a spectrum are these the sorts of true correlations that you see there is there is a curious correlation where some sort of mild form of Asbergers uh seems to be linked with with a lot of these companies and I I think we should always flip that around and um think of this as U like really an indictment of our society uh and ask the question what is it about our society where people who are uh socially well adapted are um subtly talked out of all their original ideas before they even have them because they pick up on all these social cues and they can sense oh this is a little bit too weird this is a little bit too strange it's not quite respectable what do people think of this and uh you are talked out of your truly original and creative ideas before they are even fully formed you're picking up on all these social cues and they um and they they lead you to to give up on them so I think I think there is some sort of dynamic like this um they've done this study at Harvard Business School of which which you can think of as a very non- asger like place where you have people who are super well well adapted socially they're very extroverted uh they don't have very strong convictions generally um and they are sort of in this hot house environment for two years where they talk to one another about what they will do for the rest of their lives and uh the the sort of conclusion at the end of the two years is that the largest cohort generally goes into uh trying to catch the last wave which is always somewhat of a mistake in 1989 everybody wanted to work for Michael milin it was one one or two years before he went to jail for all the junk bomb Trading people were never interested in technology or Silicon Valley except in 99 2000 at the top of the dotc Mania when they they all moved to Silicon Valley 2005 to 07 it was all real estate and and private equity and um and so I do think uh I do think there's some very odd Dynamic like that so what mistakes are we in the tech world making now you know there are there are probably well there many categories of mistakes that that we're making you know certainly one one one broad category that flows from my My Monopoly thesis is that um you often want to look at small markets if you want to get to be to be a monopoly you have to get to large markets chair so you want to go after small initial markets you know Facebook initially went after the 10,000 people at Harvard it went from 0 to 60% market share in 10 days and that was a very auspicious start and then you sort of grew out in concentric circles PayPal uh our initial Market was eBay power sellers there were about 20,000 of them and we got to about 30% market share within about 3 months again a a very good start um you know the the opposite end of the spectrum um you know one of the sort of one of the big red flags in any presentation I get is where the first slide says we have a big market and this was this was a this was a mistake that all the clean tech companies in the last decade made where um the first slide was we have a we're in the energy Market it's measured in hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars uh and we are a tiny minnow in a vast ocean and uh what that means is that you have to not just beat the other um nine thin film solar panel companies but then you have to also beat the other 90 other types of solar panel companies and then you have to beat the wind companies and the fracking companies and the U and then you have Chinese manufacturing come out of nowhere and so you're sort of minnow in a vast ocean not you want to be I think the phrase you use is most clean tech Founders would have been better off opening a new vegan restaurant in Palo Alto but you do talking they're both trillion dollar Market Restaurant Market is also trillion dollar trillion dollar market but then it does come down to timing because there's a lot of very effective clean tech businesses now one of them is Solar City Elon musk's business and his cousins which you have invested in um and is it about choosing the timing well I think it's you have to get a number of things right so I think you have to get the Monopoly question right you have you have to get the timing question right you have to get you know there's be I I think you want to have some secret that you understand that other people don't you want to get the team right so there a whole a whole set of these things that uh that that uh that come together um you know I I I I I think that um you know I think Tesla is a very impressive company that that that has that that has has has worked uh incredibly well um and in some sense they actually started with a with a what was sort of a relatively small Market electric sports cars were a actually a smaller Market than the energy Market as a whole it was still a pretty big Market it was still non-trivial to to raise the roughly half billion dollars in capital it it took but um but it was about as they to did about as um as as it was a small Market that was about as big as you could possibly be Elon Musk your co-founder at PayPal as well as producing cool electric cars and solar panels is sending space Rockets up eventually to Mars yes just the space station the shortterm how do we get more Elon musks you know it's it's um I I I I you know it's always I don't I don't know if there's a simple formula for this we had um um it's uh you know the the PayPal business was actually quite successful in producing a series of these entrepreneurs there been uh about uh of the 220 people who were involved with uh PayPal in um 2002 in in Silicon Valley uh there had been about7 billion doll plus companies started by them so elon's Tesla and SpaceX I was involved in starting paler friend Reed Hoffman started LinkedIn um YouTube YouTube uh Yammer Yelp um and um and so it's always a question what was it about PayPal that was so conducive to this and it's it's always hard to know because whenever you have just like a sample size of one it was one company sort of happened you know it's always hard to to Really um be too scientific about it but but one of the variables that I think may have been very important was that the lesson people learned inside PayPal was that it was hard but possible to build a great business so we had a lot of ups and downs there were a lot of challenges but at the end it was a very successful exit to to eBay um I think the lesson people learn in most of the companies they're involved in is very different they're either in companies where things fail and the lesson they learn is that it's impossible to build a great business so if you work in a failed company you will typically the next time around try to do something uh less ambitious you may succeed but it will be a lesser business uh because you will aim for something smaller um or if you're in a super successful company where everything just worked seem seamlessly from day one a Microsoft or a Google um you will learn the lesson that it's easy um and I think uh to build a great business which I think is just as toxic as the lesson that it's impossible and so I think most people end up finding themselves in contexts where they learn that it's easy or impossible to build great bu businesses and these are equally mistaken lessons I think the the intermediate one that uh and the intermediate mindset that it's hard but possible is a is a critical component uh to it pretty much every major city around the world now is trying to become the local Silicon Valley Consultants are making a fortune teaching Innovation to governments um how reproducible is the success story of the valley you're in London now we have a lot of very very successful companies do you take London seriously as a tech center well I'm I'm always skeptical of copying things so I I think just like you shouldn't try to copy Microsoft Facebook um copying Silicon Valley is probably also the wrong idea um you know one one reason it's the wrong idea is we don't even actually know what makes Silicon Valley work maybe it's the weather maybe it's non-compete Agreements are not enforced in California maybe it is there are these crazy Network effects there sort of all kinds of um you know uh different explanations one can give and so um even if we wanted to I'm not sure we even know what what makes it work and then I think more fundament Al when you're when you're copying something you already are setting yourself up to be defined in a lesser way you know if you're the if you're the Oxford of Iceland that's not quite Oxford and and and and so in a similar way um uh calling things um you know there's some way which you don't want to you don't want to Define your way yourself in a way that's that's derivative the something of somewhere is often the nothing of nowhere um I think that um I think instead what one should try to do is think really hard what are the kinds of things that uh could be done say in London better than anywhere else in the world um you know I think one of the things that uh that so I think for example you know we're we're investors in transfer wise and I think I think think is doing great as a as a company uh and I think uh I think there's perhaps a lot of innovation in the area of financial technology that could take place in in London because um this is a finance center it's a natural thing that London can do much better than Silicon Valley Silicon Valley is not a Global Financial Center um and uh it's London I think is also better than New York by the way since um uh people in New York uh New York's very self-hating people hate the finance industry in New York in a way in which they don't hate it as much in London so if you start a financial technology company in London this would be a cool thing to do it would not be considered as cool a thing to do in New York you invested I think in Deep Mind an artificial intelligence company and you have sort of you have sort of eccentric British Tech technologies that get developed too um and uh this is a company that Google bought for 400 million pound and they hadn't released a product um so it's it's the uh yeah it was sort of a Manhattan project for AI that was the that was the uh uh that that was and Remains the the goal of deep minds they assembled a phenomenal uh phenomenally talented team and and I think uh so I think are there are things like that that that that work uh that work quite well but but you know there's no reason that innovation in general has to happen only in Silicon Valley you know there Silicon Valley does have some advantages but it probably also has disadvantages the network effects that help Silicon Valley um I think also in some cases probably um lead to more leming like and crowd likee Behavior which I think is is so problematic do you worry about what artificial intelligence will do to us to our ability to earn a living I think I think I I'm of the view that strong AI is still quite a long long ways off um you know if we ever were to get artificial intelligence if we were ever to build computers that are as smart as human beings in every way uh this would be an a momentous event this would be you know it would be as as significant as extraterrestrials landing on this on this planet um and you know if aliens landed the first question would not be about the economy and what does it mean for your job the first question would be political are they friendly are they unfriendly and so um so I think uh I think uh to even frame it as a question about jobs is to understate the importance or or or um seismic nature AI would represent um I think short of strong AI however I I think people um are way too worried about computers in this economic sense I think this we have we live in a we live in a society that's generally um is is we live in a financial and a capitalistic age I I sort of argued elsewhere that I think we do not live in a scientific or technological Age and and uh and most people in the US Western Europe really don't like science they don't like technology they're biased against it and all sorts of ways it's true of people it's true of the politicians it's true of the governments it's true of the culture the easy way to see this is you just look at all the Hollywood movies that basically show technology that doesn't work that kills people it's destructive you can choose whether it's the Matrix or Terminator or Avatar or elisium I watched the Gravity movie the other day you'd never want to go to Mars even to outer space you'd be much happy happy happier being back on some muddy Island somewhere um on on this world and that's that reflects the sensibility of most people that the future is something to be feared and that should uh that we should try to that we should try to prevent and I um and that's why I think uh people who are involved in the scientific or technological worlds are the counterculture in our society today uh and um and it is sort of a very unusual perspective to think that the future something we hope for so roundabout answer um so I think this this idea that um today's computers are uh replacing people um is just another one of these technological unst narratives we have I think it's not true I think computers and people are fundamentally different uh they're good at really different things they're fundamentally complimentary not substitutes the you know the the much bigger challenge for the middle class and the developed world comes from globalization because people in India people in China are actually not that different from us they can substitute for our labor and that's where that's where the substitution is taking place I don't think we should stop globalization but we should you know it has some problematic aspects I think technology has far fewer you also think that technology can help fight aging how much can we solve this problem in our lifetimes well we we've made a we've made a lot of progress over the last 150 years you know the the maximum life expectancy in 1840 was 46 years among Swedish women today it's uh something like 87 88 years life expectancy has gone up by about 2 and a half years um a decade so every day that you survive your life expectancy goes up by five or six hours um I think that um um and so there's always been this debate between the uh you know the mathematicians who sort of extrapolated these curves and the biologists who always argued that um you you weren't going to make any more progress you're about to hit the wall um and I I would I would tend tode with the mathematicians over the biologists and I think I think we can do we can do a lot more um I I don't think we're going to solve you know um we're going to find sort of a single magic pill that um that makes people live forever I think it will be a lot of specific blocking and tackling but I think you know I think we could make a lot of progress on cancer I think there's no reason that we could not cure Alzheimer's or dementia you know one out of three people at age 85 has dementia I think we could be doing a lot more and it's it's really um you know it's always again I think it's outrageous that our culture is so complacent about these things and uh again I think there's room for um a lot of progress in these areas so when you hear of supporters of the singularity people like rers well talking about being able to defeat aging the body can live forever what do you think well I think I think it's you know I think this has been this has been a core um animating idea of the entire modern scientific project uh you know the uh the search for U the Water of Life that the Alchemists had was as great as for the thing that would trans mute everything into gold they were actually the Alchemists were more interested in living forever than in finding uh the the thing that substituted everything for gold it was you know Francis Bacon the new Atlantis this is this is the whole the whole project of uh of modern science and so uh so you know it's it's hard to know how much you know how much we can you know change the world from a place where life is nasty brutish and short but um but I think uh I think the the moral thing is to is to push it as far as we possibly can in the other direction you know I know there are all sorts of arguments on the other side people say that you know death is a natural part of life uh and I to which I always respond that I think um it is at least as natural for us to be fighting death and uh and I think that you know we have this modality where we are either we either accept it or deny it and I think most people are sort of in the schizophrenic mode where they um accept death and deny it at the same time um and what acceptance and denial however have in common is they're both um modes of thinking that stop you from doing anything it's going to happen or there's nothing you can do about it's not going to happen or it's going to happen and there's nothing you can do about it both those modes tell you that you shouldn't do anything and I think we should U be spending more time fighting it I'm quite upset that we're not having an argument actually I feel I'm missing out on the Peter tail experience you're not shouting me down um you're a man with I never shout people down you're a man with political views um you have strong views about education and other things let me just imagine with you that you're suddenly in the white house it's not going to happen let's just imagine I I always think thought I always think fictional thought experiments are very treacherous things though but let's just say you change does it mean does it mean that I'm mayor of the United States I'm kissing babies all day long or mean that I'm dictator how far can we play this thought experiment what would you want to change in how America is run well you know uh my my my uh you know my my single issue is that uh we have to make more progress in science and technology and uh you know I I don't think the government can do that much on this because it's so hostile to these things reflects a population that's hostile think get best we can hope that the government um gets out of the way of of stopping this sort of progress there was a time in the past When government was able to coordinate things and do things I I don't think we're living in that sort of a society anymore you know um the US was able to build a nuclear bomb in three and a half years in a project organized by the government or you could put someone on the moon in the Apollo program the 1960s um these sorts of things would be utterly inconceivable today you know a letter from Einstein to the White House would get lost in the mail room and people would say you know who is this crazy scientist who thinks you can do this uh this completely different sort of a thing um and so I think um I think the the the best role for government in our our world is is is somewhat more limited uh because you know it's I I looked at this the other day there you know 535 congressmen and senators in the US and by a generous count maybe 35 of them have a background in science or engineering um and the rest of them are like in the Middle Ages you know they don't know that solar panels don't work at night or windmills don't work when the wind is not blowing and um and so uh and so I think we we can't have that great a hope for how much Innovation can happen from government if that's if that's how it's constit now again if we can change everybody in the government that's now we're again playing with a very crazy thought experiment though governments are trying to map the brain though Obama's got a big project the Europeans have a big project look there's there's there's a lot of funding that goes to various kinds of ideas but um the the politicization of the funding I think has uh has often had this counterproductive effect you know in much of science I I I worry that there's been a sort of gresham's law at work where the people who are Nimble in the art of writing Grant applications to governments have replaced The Eccentric people who are the truly great scientists and so the uh the um The Eccentric University Professor is a species that I think is going extinct very fast um uh because of the sort of Gram's law Dynamics yes there's there's a lot of money going to projects the projects that get funded are consensus projects the experiments that get done are experiments that everybody thinks will work and experiments that everyone thinks will work are ones that I I think rarely Advanced science at all the interesting experiments are ones that no one thinks work and that actually end up working but those those are very hard to fund politically so you've been back backing a seasteading organization to try and create a new kind of nation how's that going uh that still has a long ways to go um it is it is um it is a it's a small project I got involved in it it it always generates enormous interest um because I think I think people do have a sense that the frontier is somewhat closed and there's something odd and that there's no longer a place you can go to in this world where you could start a new community or new society and so um so even talking about doing something as speculative as building uh communities on on platforms on the ocean um naturally um generates an enormous amount of of conversation uh you know I think I think it you I think figuring out ways to reopen the frontier is is very important it's not clear we can do it geographically because you know the land surface is fully covered outer space is still pretty far away um but uh but I think you know the frontier is this place where new things happen there's sort of a certain logic to California being the place where so much Innovation happened it was the place where the GE graphical Frontier ended you went West to go to the frontier the frontier ended in California and even though it's geographically you know are finished exploring it um it uh it is still a place where a lot of new things happen so on the founders fund website you famously say that we wanted flying cars instead we got 140 characters what have you got against Twitter you have to always put this in some some context so I think that um so so it's it's a I I think that Twitter is a has a great business model um you know it's it's uh it's in some ways so such a good business model that um and when you have a monopoly like Twitter has on on the service they they built out uh you often don't have to run your business uh in quite as operationally tight a way as uh you as you would if you were say opening a restaurant or something like that so so I think uh Twitter is a great business but uh there is always a sense that it's not enough to um take our civilization to the next level and this is always sort of the idea that we need to do things not just in the world of bits we should also be trying to do more things in in the world of Adams the narratives we always tell in our our media are ones of specific failure linked to General failure or specific success linked to General success and so it would be Twitter is a great business and therefore look at how much is happening in technology um and I think we we need to consider that uh it's it's a specific success that's perhaps obscuring a lot of General failures you know the the uh the cell phones that uh um that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroundings are strangely old that we live in these old cities where transportation systems are maybe from the 19th or early 20th century where you a lot of stuff has not changed in a very long time and so so it's it's sort of so yes I think Twitter itself is a great company um it's not enough to take us to the next level now I I now it's it's always this often gets framed as you know a critique of the Twitter Founders why couldn't they have built something like flying cars and I think that's that's very unfair because they did build a great company and we shouldn't blame them it really the blame is on all of us for not working on these other things there is a startup in Slovakia that we just featured in wide called erom mobile that is making a flying car by the way what do you think when you see Uber value at 17 billion and WhatsApp bought for $19 billion and Snapchat worth somewhere above1 billion what do you think about the the valuations well uh there there is sort of always this recurrent question whether we have a bubble in technology like we had in the in the late 9s uh I tend to think that there is no bubble in in Tech because uh these bubbles are psychosocial phenomena in which you get the entire public uh involved and um and the public has largely been absent this time around the IPOs are happening very very late they're far fewer of them than there were in the late 90s and so you do not have the sort of public frenzy around technology that you had in 99 uh 2000 uh you know if I had to identify a bubble today we had a bubble in Tech in the '90s we had a Housing Finance one in the last decade the obvious place where the bubble exists today is in uh government and in you know government's printing money it's in uh it's in government bonds probably which is what what a government's are sort of buying up with all the money they're Printing and so I think that the place that are bubble and you know in some ways the interest rates that are set by the government touch everything but uh the center of the bubble are probably things that are most like government bonds it's government bonds corporate bonds maybe it's uh parts of the housing market that are very linked to fixed income maybe it's parts of the equity Market that behave like fixed income so it's stocks that pay high dividends or it's uh or it's these sort of value stocks where you have very predictable cash flows um whereas the tech stocks are primarily valued on growth which is a very different variable I personally have about three quarters of my net worth tied up in a liquid tech stocks in Silicon Valley and elsewhere and um I I actually think that it's one of the best places to hide from this massive government bubble that exists everywhere else so I I think there is a bubble it's not in Tech it's in government and I I invest in Tech in order to hide from the bubble in government what is the one that you wish you'd invested in that you missed well there always are there always are um many uh misses uh that one one has um uh but you know I think sort of the the misses that really that count as misses are ones where you spend some time talking the company you have a real conversation you really think about it so I missed out on you know the series aound at YouTube I missed out on the series a round at zingga I had you know lots of conversations with Mark Pinkus and known him for many years and was very close to doing it but far bigger Miss than those two uh was not doing the series B round at Facebook um and um and I think it's sort of very instructive uh sort of set of mistakes that happened um you know on the on the on the um and we done this I was the seed investor did the series a round um August of 2004 it had sort of a post money valuation of 5.6 5.7 million and know and Facebook was just growing very fast sort of eight months later um you know they sort of um got this financing Round The Washington Post was offering 50 million and then you know Excel uh Venture fund Silicon Valley came in much higher valuation at 85 million um it was 12 times the price per share of the of the uh of the first round the middle of delution but so with much higher valuation in just eight months and I this this conversation with uh with Mark and was like you know why don't you do the this whole round kind of like you and said it's like gone up so much and and it felt like we had really maximized the valuation um and and and part of the psychology was that on the inside it didn't feel like things had changed that much you had this horrible graffiti art on the wall wall of the office there were sort of it was still only eight or nine people so every day that you went to the office uh you it actually felt like it was the same company you had been at the day before um it was true there were these uh these uh charts where things were moving in a very happy North northeasterly Direction but um but they were very these were abstractions that people I think didn't fully fully get in away and so um so um and so whenever you have these massive upgs in companies led by um by smart investors um almost as a rule of thumb uh they are undervalued and I've done this back testing on this where the steeper the UPR round the greater the undervaluation and it's because when these companies have momentum people underestimate the momentum they underestimate when things change they underestimate how much things have changed and it's not just true of the outside investors it's also true of the people on the inside you know I I course corrected on this in the series C round in Facebook which was at 525 million pre just one year later and so it's was like 5x again and uh and it was sort of this question what did what had I done wrong and and I think I think it was like okay this this makes no sense at all this is a really crazy valuation but I'm I'm going to still invest because um there's something about the momentum that people are missing and that that was that was actually a um round that I'm very glad to have participated in how did it work out well so it Facebook is worth worth more than 550 million which is the post money on that round today just last question for me before I revoke My Monopoly position and invite the room to ask some questions what do Facebook become long term you know I have to always be a little bit careful what I say about Facebook since I'm on the board of directors there but I think I think you know I think that I I think it is um it is a founder-led company uh which means that um it will uh it will it's very focused on innovation on continuing to develop a lot of new things broadly in this in this social networking space um I'm I'm generally the most bullish on the founder-led companies in Silicon Valley you know Amazon Google Facebook uh jobs did a phenomenal job when he came back to Apple and there is a certain amount of Freedom that Founders have that the um politician CEO people that often get brought in to run these companies simply uh do not have so we have two rules for the questions now um the first rule is it must have a question mark at the end and the second rule is it must be a genuine question about Peter not some of your own projects and anybody who disobeys gets put on a floating country somewhere of California um if we can have the lights up a little and there are people with microphones and if you would like to ask Peter a question raise your hand and there's a hand that's just shut up over there and we can have another microphone somewhere at the back over there cheers uh I'm quite interested uh because you obviously started speaking and the book's mainly about zero to one about making you know a completely new market in which to fill I wanted to get your opinion on kind of the business model behind rocket internet because of course they're the complete opposite of we just completely copy and imitate at speed well I don't I don't think it's a technology company I mean it's a it's a globalization play it's it's about copying things that work and uh and sort of um um copying them elsewhere in the world um and so uh it it may work uh it uh it uh you know it's uh you have I think there are some tough questions about how is rocket different from ideal lab which was sort of had had this incubation model that that blew up famously in the late '90s I I think the the argument rocket would make that is different is that it has a formula that is just repeating mechanically um and I think it's a it's a play on globalization I I I'm not interested that much in globalization I think it's important but I'm much more interested in technology but I think investors have to evaluated as as a as a you know as as a globalization place like investing in McDonald's and China or something like that question over here and then another hand on this side I've got a mik here if that's okay my name's Katie I'm from nine others and thank you very much Peter I really appreciate your time speaking to us I think we've all been inspired by your book and by your story and what I'd like to know is what inspires you where do you go to to find inspiration from what you read or who you meet or places you visit and that sort of thing well it's um I'm always really bad at answering these sorts of personal questions but but I I think it's I I find tremendous inspiration from just uh all the terrific people that I I get to work with uh you know so there's something there's a dynamism to that that's uh that's incredibly uh incredibly motivating and inspiring and uh you know I think there are all these ways in which uh one can be pessimistic about certain Trends and certain things in our societies but uh but I I think there there is sort of a very powerful an antidote in the sort of indomitability of the human spirit that is sort of a an enormous part of the of the tech scene in Silicon Valley and elsewhere is there a microphone with somebody here hi Peter uh one question why you are so sure that the next Innovation Way will be in the states if necessity is the model of innovation I think there is a very interesting story in Japan also the flash already tra for 20 years of good infrastructure in robotics Fukushima tragedy geopolitical problems so what about Japan well I I think Japan is is very interesting there's there's definitely a logic I I would look I I generally think the place to look is the developed world because that's that's the place where people need to do new things the developing World they can just copy stuff um so I I I do think you look at us Scandinavia you know northern Europe UK Israel um and then Australia Canada New Zealand um and and then I think certainly Japan is is a very interesting one it's um it's you know it is um it's culturally not a place where people typically start companies so that's it's sort of so uh the idea of doing something new in a small company is is sort of a is is a is a modality that does not exist um so I think I think there may be lot of innovation in Japan but it may strangely happen in in more in larger companies than in smaller companies that would be my guess but I think I think it's very interesting and it's uh it's definitely um it's still the third largest economy in the world and it's weirdly uh very off the radar how much of your investing are you doing outside the US the bulk is the bulk is in the US it's always you know it's always we it's it always ends up uh there's always sort of some connection we have to the people where they become strongly recommended in one way or another but we we've done you know we've done some things here in the UK we've done a few things in the rest of Europe we've done some things in Israel we've done some things in Australia New Zealand so we've done some things all over somebody have a microphone on this side um I was going to say you said that you know be asperges is the key to Innovation and Facebook is taking all this data and curating a social experience and it's it's almost rewarding people to kind of complete continue to socialize so how does that they take all that data and make people innovate again I mean you've got a huge Community listening to you and you're kind of curating their social experience but are you necessarily helping that population innovate for themselves um and how do you sort of take their data forward and do something more exciting like maybe what Google's doing um and can you kind of innovate Society rather than reward it for sort of gaming social psychology well I I um you know I I think I think there are sort of all these different different parts going on I I think I I certainly do think that um that if you if you are constantly getting feedback on on your ideas and discouraged from having unconventional ideas that that is a big problem I'm not I'm not convinced that that's fundamentally what happens on on on Facebook but uh but it is I think it's a problem that we have um in society in general uh and it's something that we all need to work on overcoming um and it's it's it's very unfair to blame it on any single company I would say I don't think Facebook's doing it but um and it's unfair because I think this is this is a problem that's endemic to society we live in society we're sort of social beings on some level and and so we we we always uh take our cues from the people around us and often get talked out of our good ideas from the people around us so it's it's a very deep problem prob space for two more questions and there was somebody over here um hi there I was just wondering if you could um actually describe your first meeting with Mark Zuckerberg you know he was 19 years old uh he was uh he was very um introverted and rather quiet at the time he still is somewhat introverted uh he um you know it seemed like the we we done a lot um my friend Reed Hoffman and I uh had done a lot of homework on the whole social networking space um you know Reed had started a company called social net all the way back in 1997 seven years earlier uh and so we had thought about this a lot and um and so it actually didn't depend that much on what happened in the meeting at all we were going to invest just about no matter what so we had the meeting for an hour and then we wrote the check but uh we had we done our homework uh beforehand um I I think the the odd question about Facebook that's uh very hard to get a handle on is uh why nobody in Boston invested between February of 04 and August 04 when I met them in Silicon Valley um and I have I have this sort of crazy theory that uh that um there's there's always sort of there always are these competitive Dynamics people get caught up and that're they're very unhealthy and I think one one version of it is that older people um often don't want younger people to do better than themselves and uh and so if you're I think there were these Venture caps in Boston that were personally annoyed at how well Zuckerberg was going to do and it sort of stopped them in a way from making the investment um what I told Zuckerberg when I when I made the investment was that I I sincerely hoped that he would be far wealthier and Far more successful than I had ever been and I'm very glad that happened I interviewed Reed Huffman um who was given the chance to lead the first round of investment he was working with Shawn Parker Shan Parker said hey I've got these guys working at this place called the facebook.com and and Reed nobly said well I think there might be a conflict of interest for me but I'll introduce you to my friend Peter so I asked Reed um does he regret that how does he feel now and he said well the money I don't regret but I regret not having the chance to work with an entrepreneur like Mark um last question Peter fascinated by your comments on education um and uh love loved some of the points you made around um secrets and uh really you know how we're going to try and take civilizations to the next level my question is really um what's your view on mukes um being the facilitator of that opening up the new Pioneer um so it's always it's always a little bit uh tricky if one has uh too many companies of a given category so uh you know you don't want to be the fourth online pet food company or the 10th thin film solar panel company uh and and so I I I think there is this challenge of how are they differentiated from one another What will what will really work and so I always think that if we describe it at the level of mukes we maybe haven't uh defined the problem uh properly um but I I do think you know I do think we're at a point where uh the universities are going to change radically it is a it is an extremely um you know it's an extremely uh corrupt system we have at this point there's we have an education bubble in the US we have a trillion dollars of of student debt uh to a first approximation this has gone to pay for a trillion dollars worth of lies about the value of the education people have received um and um and I it's not at all obvious yet though what's going to what's going to replace this or how it's going to change um my um you know the the uh you know the I'm I'm I'm somewhat skeptical that it will be replaced by any sort of single unitary system you know I have this Fellowship for uh young people to start companies um and you know it's not my claim is not that everybody should do this I don't think everyone should become an entrepreneur and I think I think there is no one siiz fits-all I so I think the future will be much more heterogeneous much more diverse in terms of what people do um and uh what's what's really anomalous is the sort of unitary tracking where you have to go to an elite College you go to Yale or you go to jail there's nothing else you can do you know um and so the the uh I think the universities are perhaps in um perhaps in the same place as the Catholic church was in 150014 if we go back 500 years where uh you had sort of this monolithic way you this Universal uh way of uh body of knowledge of teaching things the difference between between the Yale and the Harvard political science faculties are probably no greater than the differences between the Dominicans and the franciscans we've all kinds of small debates within this context um uh we are we have a system of indulgences uh that's costing more and more to support this Priestly or professorial class of people uh we are told that uh it's the only way to Salvation um you must get a diploma to be saved if you do not get a diploma then you will go to hell um and I think um and I think the uh I think the the the message that I have that's uh like the 16th century reformers that's a somewhat troubling message is that you have to work out your salvation on your own you have to save yourself and uh and and that's that's I I believe that is the truth but it's a it's it's a somewhat uncomfortable one so Peter has agreed to sign some books kind of at the back outside here um what you must then do is read the book because it's a great tightly written book and then you need to start a monopoly because otherwise tonight's wasted please can we thank Peter teal thank you

## Competition is for losers

all right good afternoon uh today's speaker is Peter teal Peter was the founder of PayPal and paler and Founders fund and has invested in uh most of the tech companies in in silica Valley and he's going to talk about strategy and competition thank you for coming Peter awesome thanks uh Sam thanks for inviting me thanks for for having me uh I I sort of have a I have a single eay FS that I'm completely obsessed with in um on on the business side which is that uh if you're starting a company if you're the founder entrepreneur starting a company you always want to aim for Monopoly and um and that uh and you want to always avoid competition and so uh hence uh competition is for losers uh something we'll be talking about today I'd like to um I'd like to start  by saying something about um the the basic idea of uh when you start one the  companies um how you go about uh creating value and there's this question what makes a business valuable and I want I want to suggest that there's basically a very simple uh very simple formula that um um you you have a valuable company if two things are true uh number one that it creates X dollars of value for the world and number two that you capture y% of X and and the critical thing that uh that I think people always miss in the sort of analysis is that X and Y are completely independent variables and so um X can be very Big Y can be very small X can be of intermediate size and if Y is reasonably big you can still get a very big business so to create a valuable company you have to basically uh both create something of value and capture some fraction of the value of what you've created and sort of just to just to illustrate this as a as a contrast um  there's if you sort of compare the US airline industry with a company like Google on search um if you sort of measure by the size of these industries you could you could say that airlines are still more important than search if you just measure it say by revenues there's 195 billion in uh domestic revenues in 201 uh 2012 Google had uh just north of 50 billion um and and so and certainly sort of on some intuitive level if you said uh if you were given a choice and said well do you want to get rid of a all air travel or do you want to get rid of your ability to use search engines the intuition would be that air travel is something that's more important than search and this is of course just the domestic numbers if you looked at this globally um airlines are much much bigger than um than uh than than than than search or than Google is but uh but the profit margins are quite a bit less uh you know they were marginally profitable in 2012 12 uh I think the entire 100-year history of the airline industry the cumulative profits in the US have been approximately zero know companies make money they episodically go bankrupt they get recapitalized and you sort of cycle and and repeat and this is reflected in you know the the combined market capitalization of the of the airline Industries maybe uh something um of the US airline industry something like a quarter that of Google so so uh you have you have a search engine much much smaller than than air travel but much more valuable and I think this this reflects these very different uh valuations on X and Y so um you know if we look at perfect  competition um you know there are sort of there's some pros and cons to the world of perfect competition um on a high level uh uh it's always um this is what you study in econ one it's always it's easy to model which I think is why econ professors like talking about perfect competition um it somehow is efficient especially in a world where things are static because you have all the consumer surplus gets captured by everybody and uh and politically it's uh What uh what we're what we're told is good in our society that you you want to have competition and this is somehow a good thing um of course there are a lot of negatives uh it's it's generally not that good if you're you're um you're involved in anything that's hyper competitive um because you often don't make money I'll come back to this a little bit later so uh so I think at one end of the spectrum you have uh industries that are perfectly competitive and at the other end of the  spectrum um you have things that um I would say are monopolies and um and they're you know they're much stable longer term businesses you have more Capital uh and um and if you get a creative Monopoly for inventing something new I think it's symptomatic of having created something something really valuable um and so I do think this you know the the the sort of the the the extreme binary view of the world I I always articulate is that there are exactly two kinds of businesses in this world there are businesses that are perfectly competitive and there are businesses that are monopolies and um there's shockingly little that is in between and uh this dichotomy is not understood very well because uh people uh are constantly lying about the nature of the businesses they're in um and this is why this is in my mind this is the most important is not necessarily the most important thing in business but I think it's the most important business idea that people don't understand that there are just the two kinds of businesses and so let me say a little bit about the lies that people tell and  so you basically um the basic uh if you sort of imagine that there was a spectrum of companies from perfect  competition to Monopoly um the um the apparent differences are quite small because the people who have monopolies pretend not to they will basically say uh you know and it's because you don't want to get regulated by the government you don't want the government to come after you so you will never say that you have Monopoly so anyone who has a monopoly will pretend that they're in incredible competition and on the other end of the spectrum if you are incredibly competitive um and if you're in some sort of business where you will never make any money um you will be tempted to tell a lie that goes in the other direction where you will say that you're doing something unique um that um is is somehow uh less competitive than it looks because um because you want to you will want to differentiate you want to try to trct Capital or something like that so if the monopolists pretend not to have monopolies the non- monopolists pretend to have monopolies the apparent difference is very small whereas the real difference I I would submit is is actually quite big and so there's this Distortion that happens because of the lies people tell about their businesses and the lies are sort of in these these opposite direction let me let me drill a little bit down further on the uh the way these lies work and so um you know the the the basic uh lie you tell as a  non-m monopoly is that we're in a very small Market the basic lie you tell as a monopoly is that the market you're in is much bigger than it looks and so um and so typically if you want to think of this in sort of set theoretic terms you could say that a monopoly tells um a a lie where you describe your business as the union of these vastly different markets and the non- monopolist describes it as the intersection so that uh in effect um if you're if you're a non- monopolist you will rhetorically describe your Market as super small you're the only person in that market if you have monopo you will describe it as super big and um and there's lots of competition in it so uh some examples of how this how this works in practice uh  so I always use restaurants as the example of a terrible business this always you know sort of my idea is you know capitalism and competition are antonyms um capitalist is someone who accumulates Capital world of perfect competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away so uh you're opening a restaurant business no one wants to invest because you just lose money so you have to tell some idiosyncratic narrative and you will say something like well we're the only British food restaurant in paloalto so it's British paloalto and uh and of course that's too small a market because people may be able to drive all the way to Mountain View or even Meno Park um and there probably are no people who eat nothing but British food at least no people who are still alive and so so that is um that's that's a sort of a fictitiously narrow Market  um there's there's sort of a Hollywood version of this where uh the way movies  always get pitched is you know okay it's like a college football star you know uh joins an elite group of hackers to um to catch the shark that killed his friend um sorry and so that's now that is a movie that has not yet been made but um but but the question is is is that the right category or is the correct category it's just another movie in which case you know there are lots of those it's super competitive incredibly hard to make money no one ever makes money in Hollywood uh doing movies or it's really really hard and so you always have this question about does the intersection does is it real does it make sense does  it have value that one should ask and of course there are startup versions of this where you and the the sort of the  bad really bad versions you just take a whole series of buzzword sharing mobile social apps you combine them and you have some kind of uh narrative and whether or not that's a real business or not uh is is uh um is it's generally a bad sign so it's it's almost this pattern recognition when you have this rhetoric of the sort of intersections um it it it generally does not work the something of somewhere is really mostly just the nothing of nowhere and it's like the Stanford of North Dakota uh one of a kind but it's not  Stanford um so let's look at the opposite the opposite law is um if you are uh let's say uh the uh the search uh company that's down the street from here and has about a happy 66% market share um and uh is you know is completely complely dominant in the search Market um Google has not almost never describes itself as a search engine these days um and instead it uh it describes itself in all these different ways so it sometimes says it's an advertising company so if it was search you'd say wow this this like it's it's it has this huge market share that's really really crazy it's it's like a incredible Monopoly it's much bigger than it's much a much more robust Monopoly than Microsoft ever had in the 90s maybe that's why it's making so much money um but if you uh if you say it's an advertising Market you could  say well there's search advertising is 17 billion and that's part of uh online advertising which is much bigger and then you know all us advertising is bigger and then by the time you get to Global advertising that's close to 500 billion and so you're talking about 3 and a half% so um a tiny part of uh of this much larger market um or uh if you don't want to be an advertising company you can always say that you're a technology  company um and so um sorry let me see um and so the and and so um and and the technology Market is something like a one trillion Doll Market and the narrative that you tell as Google in the in the technology Market is um well we're competing with all the car companies with our self-driving cars we're competing with Apple on TVs and iPhones uh we're competing with Facebook we're competing with Microsoft on um on Office Products we're competing with Amazon on cloud services and so we are in this giant technology Market where there's competition in every direction uh you you look and uh no we're not the Monopoly the government's looking for and we should not get regulated in any way whatsoever and so I think one has to always be super aware that there are these uh these very powerful incentives to to uh to distort uh the nature of these markets one way or or the other so um you know the the the  evidence of narrow markets in the uh in the tech industry is um is if you basically just uh if you look at sort of the some of the big tech companies Apple Google Microsoft Amazon um they just um they've just been building up cash for um year after year and you have these incredibly High profit margins and I would I would say that the the one of the reasons the tech industry in the US has been uh has been so successful financially is because it's it's prone to creating all these Monopoly like businesses and that's that's um and it's reflected uh by the fact that these companies just accumulate so much cash they don't even know what what to do with it Beyond a certain point um and so so let me say um let me say a few things about uh about how to how to build a monopoly and I think uh I think  the one of the sort of very counterintuitive ideas that comes out of this Monopoly uh thread is that um you  want to go after small markets if you're a startup um you know you want to get to a monopoly you're starting a new company you want to get to Monopoly um Monopoly is you have a large share of a market how do you get to a large share of a market you start with a really small market and you take over that whole market and then uh and then over time you find ways to expand that market in in concentric circles and uh the thing that's always a big mistake is going after a giant market on on day one because that's typically evidence that um that you somehow haven't defined the categories correctly that and it's it normally means that there's going to be too much competition in one way or another and so I think almost all the successful companies uh in Silicon Valley had some model of starting with small markets and expanding and you know if you take Amazon you start with you  start with you know just um a bookstore we have all the books in the world so it's it's a it's a it's a better bookstore than anybody else has in the world when it starts in the 90s it's online there's things you can do you can't do before and then you gradually expand into all sorts of different forms of e-commerce and other things beyond that um you know eBay you start with Pez dispensers you move on to beanie babies and eventually uh it's it's all these different um auctions for all these sorts of different Goods um and uh and what was very counterintuitive about what's very counterintuitive about many of these companies is they often start with markets that are so small that people don't think um they don't think that they're uh valuable at all when when you get started um the the PayPal version of this was uh was you know we started with uh with power sellers on eBay which was about 20,000 people when when we first saw this happening in December of 99 January 2000 right after we launched uh there was a sense that uh that these were all um it was such a small Market it was terrible we thought these were terrible customers to have it's just people selling junk on the internet why in the world do we want to be going after this Market but um but you you know you there was a way to get a product that was much better for everybody in that market you could um and we got to something like 25 30% you know Market penetration in 2 or 3 months and you got some Walkin you got brand recognition and you're able to to build the business from there so um so I always think these um these these very small markets are are quite underrated uh the Facebook version of this I always give is that uh you know the initial Market at Facebook was 10,000 people at Harvard it went from 0 to 60% market share in 10 days that was a very auspicious start um the way this gets analyzed in Business Schools is always um that's ridiculous it's such a small Market it can't have any value at all and so I think the business school analysis of Facebook early on or of PayPal early on or of eBay early on is that the markets were perhaps so small as to have uh almost no value uh and they they would have had little value had they stayed small but it turned out there were ways to then grow them concentrically and that's what made them uh that's what made them so valuable um now I think the opposite version of this is always where you have super big markets and um and I there's so much so many different things that went wrong with all the clean tech companies in the  last decade but uh but one one theme that ran through almost all of them was they all started with massive markets and every clean tech PowerPoint presentation that one saw in the Years 2005 to 2008 which was sort of the clean tech bubble in in Silicon Valley started with we're in the energy Market we're in a market that's measured in hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars and um and then you know once you're sort of a a minnow in a vast ocean um that's not a good place to be that means that you have tons of competitors and you don't even know who all the competitors are and so you want to be you know you want to be a one-of-a-kind company where it's the only one in a small ecosystem you don't want to be the fourth online pet food company you don't want to be the 10th thin film solar panel company you don't want to be the 100th restaurant in paloalto um you know restaurant industry is a trillion dollar industry so if you do a market size analysis youd include restaurants are a fantastic business to go into and it's often large markets large existing markets typically mean that you have uh tons of competition very very hard to uh to differentiate so the first very counterintuitive int uh idea is is to go after small markets often markets that are so small people don't even notice them they don't think they make sense that's where you get a foothold and then um and then if those markets are able to expand you can scale into a big monopo business um you know um a second uh sort of there's sort of several different uh  characteristics of these Monopoly businesses um that I like to um focus on and U there's probably no no sort of  single formula to it and I I always think that uh that in technology there's always a sense that you know the history of technology such that every every moment happens only once and so you know the next Mark Zuckerberg won't build a social network the next uh uh the next Larry Page won't be building a search engine the next uh Bill Gates won't be building an operating system and if you're copying these people you're not learning from them but it's it's and so um there is always um these very unique businesses that are doing something that's not been done before end up um end up having the potential to be a monopoly if you're you know the the the opening the opening line in um Anna Ken is that all happy companies sorry all happy families all happy families are alike all unhappy families are unhappy in their own special way and the opposite is true in business where I think all happy companies are different because they're doing something very unique all unhappy companies are alike because they fail to escape the essential sameness that is competition and so so one one sort of characteristic of a monopoly technology company is some sort of proprietary technology um my sort of crazy somewhat arbitrary rule of thumb is you want to have a technology that's an order of magnitude better than the next best thing so Amazon had over 10 times as many books I it's maybe not that Hightech but you figure out a way to sell 10 times as many books in an efficient online way you know PayPal the alternative for PayPal was using um was using uh uh checks to uh send money on eBay took 7 to 10 days to clear PayPal could do it than 10 times as fast so you want to have some sort of very uh very powerful Improvement in some um on in some order maybe an order of magnitude Improvement on some key Dimension um of course you know if you if you actually come with something totally new um it's it's it's just like an infinite Improvement so I would say the the iPhone was the first smartphone that worked and so that's you know that's like maybe maybe not infinite but it's sort of definitely an order of magnitude or more of an improvement so I think uh the the technology is designed to give you a massive Delta over over the next the next best thing I think um I think there often are network effects that can kick in that really help the thing that's very um and these these lead to monopolies over time the thing that's very tricky about Network effects is uh they're often uh they're often very hard to get started and so um so even though everyone understands how valuable they are uh there's always this incredible tricky question why is it valuable to the first person who's doing something um economies of scale uh if you have something that with very high fixed costs very low marginal costs uh that's typically a monopoly like business and then um then there's this thing uh of of branding uh which is sort of like just uh this idea that gets lodged in people's brains I I never quite understand how branding Works uh so I never invest in companies where it's just about branding but it is I think a real phenomenon that uh that creates uh that creates real value I think one of the things I'm going to come back to this a little bit towards the end but one of the things that's very striking is that software businesses are often um are for some reason uh very good at some of these things they're especially good at the economies of scale part because the marginal cost of software is zero and so if you get something that works in software um it's often significantly better than the existing solution and then you have these tremendous economies of scale and you can scale fairly quickly so even if the market start small um you can grow your business quickly enough to uh stay um stay at the same size as the growing market and uh and maintain the sort of Monopoly uh Power now the critical thing about these monopolies is um is it's it's not enough to have a monopoly for just a moment the critical thing is to have one that lasts over time um and so you know in Silicon value is the sort of idea that you want to be the first mover and I I always think it's it's in some ways um the better framing is you want to be the last mover you want to be the last company in a category those are the ones that are really valuable Microsoft was the last operating system at least for many decades uh Google is the last search engine Facebook will be valuable if it turns out to be the last social networking site and um and one way to one way to think of this uh last mover uh value is this idea that most to the value in these companies exists far in the future um if you do sort of a discounted cash flow analysis of a business you look at you have sort of all these profit streams you have a growth rate the growth rate's much higher than the discount rate and so most of the value exists far in the future I did I did this exercise at PayPal in March of 2001 we had been in business for about 27 months and um and we sort of had you know the growth rate was 100% a year we were discounting future cash flows by about 30% and it turned out that about 3/4 of the value of the business as of 2001 came from cash flows in years 2011 and Beyond and um and whenever you do the math on any of these tech companies you get to an answer that's something like that so if you are trying to analyze any of the tech companies in Silicon Valley Airbnb Twitter uh Facebook um any emerging internet companies all the ones in y combinator um the math tells you that three qus 80 85% of the value is coming from cash flows in years 2024 and Beyond it's very very far in the future and uh and so one of the things that uh we always overvalue in Silicon Valley is growth rates and we undervalue durability because uh growth is something you can measure in the here and now and you can always track that very precisely um the question of whether a company's still going to be around a decade from now that's actually what what dominates the value equation and that sort of is a much more uh qualitative sort of a thing and so if if we um if we went back to this idea of these characteristics of Monopoly uh proprietary technology Network effects economies of scale um um you can think of these these characteristics as ones that exist at a moment in time where you capture a market and take it over but you also want to think about are these things going to last over time and so there's a Time Dimension to all these characteristics so Network effects often have a great time element where as the network scales the network effects actually get more robust and so if you have a network effect business that's often one that uh um can become a um a bigger and stronger Monopoly over time a proprietary technology is always a little bit of a tricky one so you want something that's an order of magnitude better than uh the state-of-the-art in the world today and that's how you get people's attention that's how you initially break through but then um you don't want to be superseded by somebody else and so there are all these areas of innovation where there was tremendous Innovation but no one made any money so uh you know dis Drive Manufacturing in the 1980s um you could you could do a better dis build a better dis Drive than anybody else you could take over the whole world and two years later someone else would come along and replace yours and in the course of 15 years you got vastly improved disc drives so it had great benefit to Consumers but um it didn't actually help the people who started these compan compies and so there's always this question about having a huge breakthrough in technology but then also being able to say explain why uh yours will be the last breakthrough uh or at least the last breakthrough for a long time or will you make a breakthrough and then you can keep improving on it at a quick enough Pace that no one can ever catch up so if you have a structure of um a structure of the future where there's a lot of innovation and other people will come up with new things in the thing you're working on um that's great for society it's um it's actually not that good for your business typically um and then um economies of scale uh where I talked about so so I think anyway so I think this last mover thing is is very  critical I'm always tempted you know I don't want to overdo the chess analogies but you know the first mover in chess is someone who plays white white is about a one-third of a pawn Advantage so there's a small advantage to uh going first you want to be the last mover um who who wins the game and so so was the Kappa Blanca uh world champion uh uh chess champion Kappa Blanca line you must begin by studying the end game and and I do think that's um well I wouldn't say that's the only thing you should study I think this uh the sort of perspective of asking these questions why will this still be the leading company 10 15 20 years from now is a uh is a really critical one to to try to think through let me um let me sort of uh I want to sort of go in two slightly other  directions with this Monopoly versus competition idea and I think um so I think this is the the central idea uh in my mind for for business for starting business for thinking about them and U and there are some some very um interesting perspectives I think it gives on the whole you know on the whole history of innovation and technology and science because um you know we we've lived through um we've lived through um you know 250 300 years of incredible technological progress in you know many many different domains uh you know steam engine to Railways  to telephones Refrigeration household appliances um you know the computer Revolution Aviation all sorts of different areas of technological innovation and then there's sort of analogous thing that one can say about science where uh we've lived through centuries of of enormous amounts of innovation in in in science as well and um and the the thing that I think um people always miss when they think about these things is um is that um because X and Y are independent variables um some of these things can be extremely valuable Innovations but uh the people who invent them who come up with them do not get rewarded for this and uh and certainly if you go back to um you need to create X dollars in value you capture y% of X I would suggest that the history of science has generally been one where y 0% across the board the scientists never make any money um they're always duded into thinking that they live in a just universe that will reward them for their work and for their inventions and this is probably the fundamental delusion that uh that scientists tend to suffer from in our in our society um and and even in technology there are sort of many different areas of Technology where um where there were great innovations that created tremendous value for society but uh but people did not uh did not actually capture uh that much of the of the value and so I think there is this sort of whole uh history of um science and technology that can be told from the perspective of how much value was actually captured and um and certainly there are entire sectors where  people didn't capture anything so you you're the smartest physicist of the 20th century you come up with special relativity you come up with general relativity you don't get to be a billionaire you don't even get to be a millionaire um it just it just somehow doesn't work that way um the railroads incredibly valuable most of them just went bankrupt because it was too much competition um right Brothers um you fly the first plane you don't make any money and so I think there is sort of the structure to these industries that's uh that's very important um and I think the uh the thing that's actually rare are the success cases most the so it's actually you really think about the history in this in this 250 years sweep um it's unus Y is almost always 0% it's always zero in science it's almost always in in technology and so it's very rare where people made money you know the early uh the late uh 18th early 19th century the first Industrial Revolution was the textile mills you had the steam engine you sort of automated things and you had these Relentless improvements that people improved efficiency of textile factories of manufacturing generally at a clip of 5 to 7% every year year after year decade after decade you had 60 70 years of tremendous improvement from 1780 to 1850 um but even in 1850 most of the wealth in Britain was still held by the landed aristocracy uh the workers didn't you know the workers didn't make that much the capitalists didn't make that much either it was all competed away there were hundreds of people running textile factories it was an industry that just uh um the structure of the competition prevented people uh from from making any money um and so I I think there are in my mind there probably are only two broad categories in the entire history of the last 250  years where people have actually uh come up with new things and made money doing so um one is uh these sort of vertically integrated complex monopolies which people uh did build in the Second Industrial Revolution at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century and so this was like Ford it was the vertically integrated oil companies like Standard Oil um and what these vertically integrated monopolies uh typically required was this very complex coordination you got a lot of pieces to fit together in just the right way uh when you assembled it you had a tremendous Advantage this is actually uh done surprisingly little today and so I think this is sort of a business form that um when people can pull it off is very valuable it's typically fairly Capital intensive uh we live sort of in a in a in a culture where it's very hard to get people to buy into anything that's super complicated and takes very long to build uh but I you know when I sort of think about my colleague Elon Musk from PayPal success with Tesla and SpaceX uh I think the key to these companies was the complex vertically integrated Monopoly structure they had so if you sort of look at Tesla or SpaceX if you ask you know was there sort of a single breakthrough I mean they certainly innovated on a LW of Dimensions I don't think there was a single 10x breakthrough in battery storage or you know maybe working on some things on rocketry but they hadn't there was no sort of single massive breakthrough but what was really impressive was integrating all these pieces together and um and doing it in a way that was more vertically integrated than most of their competitors so Tesla you also integrated The Car Distributors so they wouldn't uh steal all the money as has happened with the rest of the car industry in the US or SpaceX um you basically uh pulled in all the subcontractors um uh where most of the large uh Aerospace companies have single Source subcontractors that are able to sort of charge Monopoly profits and make it very hard for the integrated aerospace companies to make money um and so uh vertical integration I think is sort of a a very underexplored modality of of technological progress that people uh would uh would do well to look at more and then I think there is there is something about software itself that's very very powerful um software has these incredible economies of scale these low margin costs and there is something about the world of bits as opposed to the world of atoms where you can often get very fast adoption and and the fast adoption is critical to capturing and taking over markets because even if you have a small Market if the adoption rate is too slow there'll be enough time for other people to enter that market and compete with you whereas if you have a small to midsized Market and have a fast adoption rate you can uh take over this market and so and so I think this is one of the reasons Silicon Valley has done so well and why software has been of this phenomenal industry and what I what I would suggest what I would want to leave you with is there are sort of these different rationalizations people give for why certain things work and why certain things don't work and I think these rationalizations always obscure this question of um creating X Dollar in value and capturing y% of X so the science rationalization we're always told is that the scientists aren't interested in making money they're doing it for charitable reasons and that not a good scientist if you're motivated by money and I'm not even saying people should always be motivated by money or something like this but I I think we should we should be a little bit more critical of this as a rationalization we should ask is this a rationalization um uh to obscure the fact that y equals 0% and the scientists are operating in this uh in this sort of world where all the uh all the Innovation is effectively competed away and they can't capture any of it directly and then the uh the software Distortion that often happens is because people are making such vast Fortunes in software we infer that this is the most valuable thing um in the world being done full stop and so if people at Twitter make uh billions of dollars it must be that Twitter is worth far more than anything Einstein did um and um and uh and what that sort of rationalization tends to obscure is again that X and Y are independent variables and there are these businesses where you capture a lot of X and there are others where you don't and so uh and so I do think um I do think the history of innovation has been this uh this history where uh the the the the microeconomics the structure of these industries has mattered a tremendous amount and when um and um and and and there is sort of this the story where some people have made vast fortunes because they were in Industries with the right structure and other people uh made uh nothing at all because um because they were in these sort of very competitive things and we shouldn't just rationalize that way I think it's worth understanding this better and then finally let me come back to this this uh this sort of overarching theme for this  talk this competition is for losers idea which um is always this provocative way to to title things because we always think of the losers as the people who are not good at competing we think of the losers as the people who are um slow on the sports on the track team in high school or who do a little bit less well on the standardized tests um and don't get into the right schools and so we always think of losers as people who can't compete um and I want us to really rethink and and revalue this and consider whether it's possible that competition itself um is off that we we we're sort of it's not just the case that we don't understand this Monopoly competition dichotomy intellectually so sort of been talking about why why you wouldn't understand it intellectually because um people lie about it it's distorted we have all these uh the history of innovation rationalizes what happen in all these very very strange ways but I think it's more than just an intellectual blind spot I think it's also a psychological blind spot where we find ourselves you know very very attracted to competition in in one form or another um we find it reassuring if other people do things the word ape already in the time of Shakespeare meant both primate and imitate uh and there is  something about human nature that's deeply mimetic imitative apik sheeplike leming like cd-like um and it's this very very problem uh thing that we need to always think through and try to overcome and and there is always this question about um competition um as as a form of  validation where we we go for things that lots of other people are going for and um it's not that there is wisdom in crowds it's not when lots of people are trying to do something that that's proof of uh it being valuable I think it's when lots of people are trying to do something that is often um that is often proof of insanity there 20,000 people a year who move to Los Angeles to become movie stars about 20 of them make it um I think the Olympics are a little bit better because you have a you know um you can sort of figure out pretty quickly whether you're good or not so it's there's a little bit less of a dead weight loss to society um you know um um you know your your the sort of educational experience at a place uh the the the pre- Stanford educational experience um there's always sort of a non-competitive characterization I think most of the people in this room had machine guns they were competing with people with bows and arrows so um it wasn't exactly a parallel competition when you were in junior high school and high school um there's always a question does the tournament make sense as you keep going and this is uh and so um there is always this question if people go on to grad school or post post-doctoral educations does the intensity of the competition really makes sense there's the uh the you know classic uh Henry Kissinger line that uh um describing his fellow faculty at Harvard that the uh um the battles were so ferocious because the stakes were so small describing sort of Academia and um and and you sort of think on one level this is a description of insanity you know why would people fight like crazy when the stakes are so small but it's also I think simply a function of the logic of the situation when it's imp really hard to differentiate yourself from other people when the differences are when the objective differences really are small then uh you have to uh compete ferociously to maintain uh a difference of one sort uh or another um that's often more imaginary than real there's always sort of a personal uh version of this that I I tell where um you know I was sort of hyper hypert tracked I you know my e8th grade Junior High School yearbook one of my friends wrote in you know I know you'll get into Stanford in four years as a sophomore I sort of went into went to Stanford four years later uh at the end of High School uh went to Stanford Law School uh you know ended up um at a big law firm in uh New York uh where from the outside everybody wanted to get in on the inside everybody wanted to leave um and and you had um and it was this very strange Dynamic where after I uh sort of realized this was maybe not the best idea um and left after seven months and 3 days you know one of the people down the hall from me uh told me um it's really reassuring to see you leave Peter I had no idea that it was possible to escape from alcatra which of course all you had to do was go out the front door and not come back but um but so much of people's identities got wrapped up in um in winning uh these competitions that uh they somehow lost sight of what was important what was valuable uh you know competition does make you better at whatever it is that you're competing on because when you're competing you're um comparing yourself with the people around you you're figuring out how do I beat the people next to me how do I do somewhat better at whatever it is they're doing and you will get better at that thing I'm not I'm not questioning that I'm not denying that but um but it often comes at this tremendous price that uh you stop asking some bigger questions about what's truly important and truly Valu and so I would I would say that don't always go through the tiny little door that everyone's trying to rush through maybe go around the corner and go through the vast gate that no one's taking thank you very much I guess we time for you want to take a few questions or sorry oh yeah people want to take I'll  take a few questions we have a few minutes time yeah go ahead um since yeah as you mentioned earlier often  monopolies and competition often look similar because the narratives people tell the narratives we tell ourselves do you have any ways to easily determine the difference when you're looking at an idea or evaluating your own idea well I'd say the question I'm I always try to focus on is what is the actual market so not what's The Narrative of the market because you can always tell a fictional story about a market that's much bigger or much smaller but what is the what is the real objective market so it's always yeah you always try to figure it out and you realize people have incentive to distort things yeah so which of the aspects of monop that you mentioned would you say s  like Google um well they have uh they have Network effects with the the ad Network they had proprietary technology that gave them the initial lead because they had the the page rank algorithm which was uh sort of an order of magnitude better than any other search search engine you have economies of scale uh because of the need to store you know all these different uh sites and at this point you have brand so Google has all four maybe maybe the proprietary technology is somewhat weaker at this point but definitely it had all four and maybe three and a half out of four now yeah how does this apply to paler and  second what's you like second is what what with the iPhone uh head oh this is that's that's a that's a there sort of a set of companies that are doing different copycat payment systems on on mobile phones there's square there's PayPal sort of they have just they just have sort of different shapes that's how they differentiate themselves one is a triangle one is a square um and so you know um maybe at some point the Apes will run out of shapes or something like that but um but I think um no palent here we we started with a focus on on um the um intelligence Community which is small submarket um you had a proprietary technology that used a very very different approach um uh where it was focused on the human um computer uh synthesis rather than the uh uh sub substitution which I think is the dominant Paradigm so there's a whole set of things I would say on the on the market approach and the the proprietary technology uh yes um we have design  thinking methodology and uh lean uh startup thinking um which is used to mitigate Risk by not creating things that people don't want but how do young innovators uh have inspiration to create complex systems that last through time can you repeat the question yeah so the question is um what do I think about lean startups uh um iterative thinking where you get uh feedback from people uh versus uh complexity that may not work so I I am personally quite skeptical of all the uh Lean Startup methodology I think the the the really great companies um did something was sort of somewhat more of a Quantum Improvement that really differentiated them from everybody else um they they typically did not do massive you know customer surveys the people who ran these companies uh sometimes not always suffered from mild forms of Asbergers so they we not actually that influenced not that easily deterred by what other people thought or told them to do um so I I do think we're we're way too focused on um iteration as a modality and not enough on trying to um have um you know um a virtual ESP link with the public and figuring it out ourselves um I I would say that uh let me see um I would say that uh the um I I'm not quite the risk question I think is always a very tricky one because there are um you know there there it's it's not it's often I think it's often the case that you don't have enough time to really mitigate risks if you if you're going to take enough time to figure out what people want um you often will have missed the boat by then um and um and then of course there's always the risk of of doing something that's uh that's not that uh significant or meaningful so you know you you could say a track in um in law school is a lowrisk track from one perspective it may still be a very highrisk track in the sense that maybe you not um have a high risk of not doing something meaningful with your life so we have to think about risk in these uh in these very complicated way I think risk is sort of this very uh complicated concept yes you talking about the last move Advantage but then doesn't that imply that there's already competition  to begin with chest piece on the chest board um yeah so there's always this uh terminology thing so I I would say that uh there are uh there are categories in which people sort of are bundled together I would say the Monopoly businesses were in in effect they they really were a big first mover in some sense you could say you could say Google was not the first search engine there were other search engines before but on one dimension they were dramatically better than everybody else so they were the first one with page rank with with sort of a automated approach um Facebook was not the first uh social networking site my friend Reed Hoffman started one in 1997 they called it social net so they already had the name social networking uh in the name of their company seven years before Facebook uh their idea was that it was going to be this virtual cyers space where I'd be a dog and you'd be a cat and we'd have all these different rules about how we'd interact with each other in this virtual alternate reality Facebook was the first one to get real identity so it was so I'd say I hope Facebook will be the last social networking site it was the first one in a very important Dimension people often would not think of it as the first because they'd sort of lump all these things together I have one more question okay one more question let's take one  here uh if theoretically someone who uh worked at Goldman Sachs out of college and left out 6 months and is now studying computer science at Stanford uh how would you recommend rethinking that um you know I don't I don't have a I don't have a great um I'm not great at the Psychotherapy stuff so I don't I don't quite know how to I don't quite know how to uh how to solve this that there are these um you know there are these very odd stud they've done on people who go to um business school there one they've done at Harvard Business School where um it's sort of the anti- asberg um personality where you have people who are super extroverted uh generally have low convictions uh few ideas and you have sort of a hot house environment you put all these people in for two years and at the end of it uh they systematically end up the largest cohort systematically ends up doing the wrong thing they try to catch the last wave you know uh 1989 everyone at Harvard tried to work for Mike milin it was one or two years before he went to jail for all the junk bond stuff they were never interested in Silicon Valley OR tech except for 99 2000 when they timed the bubble peing perfectly um they did uh and then you know 05 to7 was housing uh private Equity stuff like this so so I do think um I do think this uh tendency for us to see competition as validation is um is very deep um I don't think there's some any sort of easy psychological formula to uh to avoid it so I don't I I don't quite know how to uh what sort of therapy to to recommend but um but my my my first my first starting point which is only like it's maybe 10% of the way is to never underestimate how big a problem it is we always think this is something that afflicts other people so it's easy for me to point to people in Business Schools or people at Harvard or people on Wall Street I think it actually does afflict all of us to a very profound degree we always think of advertising is things that work on other people how who are all these stupid people who fall for All Those ads on TV they obviously work to some extent and they work uh to a disturbing extent on all of us and it's something we we all should work to overcome thank you very much

Transcript:
(00:02) I thought I'd sort of take a somewhat different tack today and know try to talk a little bit about what I think the biggest single philosophical question in all these startups maybe even in life generally is that people have and it's um it's whether is it all just a matter of luck or how much of this is luck and how much is not luck when you start one of these businesses and and do do one of these things and it's sort of a big question that underlies a lot of a lot of these different ventures that people
(00:38) do and I want to I want to try to tackle that question at least indirectly today I want to talk a little bit about you know a little bit about the question of luck why it's very hard to answer I want to suggest to you that we live in a society where people are incredibly biased to thinking that things are dominated by luck and I want to at least suggest that there are some alternate ways of thinking about the future that it's it's worth for us to explore um let me let me start with this is probably
(01:12) sort of my my general might the general slide that I always have on the nature of progress the nature of the future and when you think about how the 21st century is going to unfold you can think that there are basically two axes to the 21st century there's a technology axis and a globalization axis they're they're very different people always use these words interchangeably but globalization is basically about copying things that already work it's the story of China and the emerging world there's still you
(01:51) know much the world six billion out of seven billion people are still incredibly poor and what they mainly have to do in the next few decades is just copy things that work there's some things where they can avoid copying bad ideas from from the developed nations but a lot of it is the sort of horizontal or extensive progress and sort of going from 1 to N but then there's also technology doing new things vertical or intensive progress and it's sort of where you're the first person or business or inventor or artist in the
(02:29) history of the world to do to do something new it's going from from zero to one and what I want to suggest is that there's there is something sort of very different about going from zero to one instead of 1 to N 1 to n is there sort of is this law of large numbers and you can sort of run the experiment many times and sort of see how things work but you when you go from zero to one there's a sense in which you know every every sort of event in the history of progress in the history of technology or
(03:04) science has something singular and non-repeatable about it and so and so if we ask you know is a given invention a given startup a given artistic achievement was this something that would have happened anyway is it something was a total fluke it's actually a really hard question to answer because you only have sort of a sample size of one to go on and you can sort of you can sort of say that that with a sample size of one you know the variance becomes infinite so it's almost impossible to know whether you were
(03:41) lucky or not and I think that's probably this sort of important starting point to have is that it's completely unclear whether or not it's luck or not and you can have certain biases on this but in anything we're going from zero to one it's very very hard to say now um there certainly is some very mild anecdotal evidence that that you can give that that's certain that the anti luck argument is that there are certain people who succeeded in doing various businesses on a repeat basis you know
(04:23) there's probably perhaps most famously still achieved Steve Jobs with you know and Pixar you know Jack Dorsey with square Twitter Mike my colleague Elon from PayPal who went on to start SpaceX and Tesla was heavily involved in Solar City of course you know there's always a counter-narrative with these things you can say well this person just each of these people had just one big breakthrough and then everything else was somehow leveraged off of that and so you know whenever you sort of drill down on this question was it luck
(04:54) was it not luck it's actually um it's actually really hard it's really hard to say it is striking however how much the way we talk about this has changed and so if you go you know if you go back in time the classical way people used to talk about it was that luck was something to be overcome or to be mastered so you know thomas jefferson i'm a great believer in luck and i find the harder I work the more I have of it which again suggests that it's it's this it's this thing to to overcome or to you
(05:34) know that's uh that doesn't dominate things or you know even simpler Samuel Goldwyn the harder I work the luckier I get I'm very much in contrast to that you have something like today's dominant view where success stems from sort of this whole context the context is random you know maybe you were a member of the lucky sperm Club the lucky egg club you know you were lucky where you were born and stuff like that and that sort of is what drives everything and there's a course you know a version of this that
(06:09) applies to startups that you know the successful ones were accidental you know it's pretty clear how big a role luck plays I agree with Paul Graham on an awful lot of things but but again I I think this is sort of a place where it's just automatically channeling our default bias as a society and it's worth asking how much of this is true and how much is is not true what I want to focus on today is um is not so much in those are two different directions you can go with this question of luck one is sort of the
(06:48) past orientation which is you know how did I get here you know what were the factors that contributed to to success but I want to focus instead on instead I want to focus on the future question of of what you know what you can do next and where you go where you go from here is this is there sort of is is and is the future is that something that's fundamentally dominated by chance or is somehow thinking of this is being dominant by chance somewhat of a somewhat of a wrong way or an incomplete way to think about the future and want
(07:34) to offer the alternate and alternate perspective on that now I want to say a little bit about the structure of the future and how people can think about the future and and you can think of it I think most simply as being determinate or indeterminate and in particular I have the sort of two-by-two matrix for the future it's sort of a consulting type type idea but you can basically on most simplistically you can say that the future is either optimistic or pessimistic and it's either determinate or indeterminate an optimistic future is
(08:15) one where you believe things will be better than the present on whatever axis defines better a pessimistic future is one where you think things will generally be worse and then a determinant future is one where you can sort of map out reasonable amounts of it and and plan against it and then an indeterminate one is a is where you have absolutely no clue and it's or just a random walk all the way certainly depending on which of these quadrants you believe is basically correct out the future it tells you some very
(08:56) different at least some very different approaches that you would pursue in terms of how you think about your life or the kinds of things you're doing and I want to sort of try to develop this framework a little bit more as we as we as we think about this so for example most simply on a determinant versus indeterminate axis you know if you believe the future is determinate you will act with with some degree of conviction you'll have specific ideas and you'll have some confidence to to to work towards those ideas if it is
(09:39) indeterminate on the number one rule is to diversify because you have no idea what's going to work and you should just try lots of different things and should have some sort of a portfolio approach to the future and so I think one of the things that's always very interesting when you think of this determinate versus indeterminate thing is that all these things that ultimately become self-fulfilling so if you if you think it's determinate and then you focus on doing one thing extremely well that sort
(10:07) of leads to conviction and then maybe that becomes self-fulfilling if you think that it's fundamentally indeterminate you end up with a portfolio approach it's diversified and it has maybe that itself becomes self-fulfilling and becomes somewhat indeterminate and it becomes more indeterminate in a way um there's of course on you know on the optimistic versus pessimistic axis the simple one is just you know are you fundamentally afraid of it do you think it's fundamentally something that's
(10:37) going to be better and these sorts of perspectives also lead to very different ways to act if you want to if you want to put this in sort of a historical context I think that I'm going to try to develop explain why I put these different zones in these quadrants but I think the u.s.
(10:57)  in the 50s and 60s and maybe even before then was fundamentally optimistic and determinate the future was clearly going to be better people thought that every generation was going to be better off the generation came before and it was for the most part in very specific ways there was a there was a determinate way in which the frontier was going to be developed there was a way that you know cars would get faster planes would get faster rockets would get faster there was sort of all these very specific ways that the future would get better from year to year and
(11:31) decade to decade I think is sort of a very different paradigm that the US had for a quarter century from 1982 to 2007 where the future was going to be better that was the official religion it was still sort of very optimistic but if you asked how or why people had no good answer for it and so it was just this this mechanistic thing that would automatically get better in one form another and so we were sort of in this quadrant of extreme indeterminate optimism I would say for about a quarter of a century from the period of 82 to
(12:10) 2007 an indeterminate pessimism is probably what characterizes most of the rest of the developed world I would say Japan's been in this zone for for the last the last 20 years people have a sense the future is going to be not that great maybe a little bit worse and nobody has an idea of what to do and I think sort of Europe has weirdly drifted into this indeterminate pessimistic quadrant as well where people think the future is worse but nobody has any idea what to do um you can sort of argue where you put China on this some people
(12:48) would put in the determinate optimistic quadrant I tend to put it on the determinant pessimistic quadrant it's very determinate people in China have a they know what it's going to look like in 20 years they're going to build out the highways in the cities and for the most part it's it I think it is going to be a somewhat poorer version of the developed world people will get old before they get rich there's a very specific way to to track against that but China comes out on this quadrant that's very different from the you
(13:21) 80222 2000-2007 if you if you think of these quadrants in terms of in terms of the sort of a financial way you could describe this which is that if you're optimistic you don't need to save a lot of money if you're pessimistic you save a lot of money so if you're super optimistic you know the future is going to be better there's no need to save any money and so you end up with a savings rate that's that's very low if you include a government borrowing in the u.s. today the u.s. savings rate today
(14:00) stands at minus 6% so we're still incredibly optimistic about the future we don't need to save any money because the future will automatically be better and so we're still maybe in an Indian summer of indeterminate optimism on the other hand for example I would describe China's quite pessimistic because it has a savings rate of something close to on 30 30 percent of GDP gets saved and so people even though there's some ways in which things are getting better from year to year people still think they'll
(14:31) be old before they get rich and therefore they need to save a lot of money so you have this low savings to high savings access from optimism to pessimism and then if you sort of that's like investing in cash or bonds or things like that saving in cash or bonds or things like that if you invest in specific things there's specific company's buildings ideas you invest in if you have a definite determinate view you'll have a high investment rate if it's indeterminate you will not know what specific things to invest in and so you
(15:08) end up with a low low investment on low investment rate and so so one of the strange things about indeterminate optimism is that it's the quadrant that has both low savings and low investment and the question I will come back to towards the end is whether that's a state that's whether that's a stable quadrant at all is it possible for the future to be better when no one saves and no one invests because no one's thinking and everyone's outsourcing all the thinking to other people one of the other ways you can
(15:43) sort of describe this difference on I want to give a few different axes for describing this shift from determinate to indeterminate ways of the future the mathematical version is that the dominant form of mathematics used to be calculus and it's shifted to probability and statistics the structural way is that in a determinant world you're focused on substance there are some specific substantive things you focus on in an indeterminant world all that you end up focusing on are processes and so what people talk about our world is
(16:17) what's the process for doing thing something much more than what is the specific thing you're trying to do to talk about specific things is to definite and that seems to two to weirdly to weirdly wrong in practice you can sort of think of these very different types of quadrants that dominate the indeterminate optimistic world is dominated by finance and law because these are the kinds of process oriented disciplines that that you pursue if you have no idea about the future if it's fundamentally about
(16:50) making sure that the piping of the system it works but you have the sense the system just sort of works automatically on in a determinate optimistic world that's probably a world in which there's much more room for engineering art you know very specific things it's people who have ideas about the future that are radically different from the present it's people who have dreams about the future that nobody else shares and that they're you know willing to work towards and where the dreams of
(17:23) a substantive Lee different and radically better world are not subsumed towards some sort of random process you know determinate pessimistic would be wartime rationing you know indeterminate pessimistic all you end up doing is buying insurance I've spoken in some context about to being a bubble in education and I think you can think of the education bubble a form of indeterminate pessimism where people are they don't really know what the education is for but it's fundamentally acts as an insurance
(17:56) policy to avoid falling through the larger and larger cracks in our society and so anyway you can sort of think about these different quadrants and depending on which one dominates there's sort of very different kinds of industries that that end up dominating you know to have a picture of what definite optimism or determinate optimism looked like you know we can we can go back to these classic examples from from US history so there are things like like the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the in the
(18:32) 19th century uh where it was a radically different future where the world you know would be connected it's a gigantic undertaking by today's standards nobody would do it people would say why are you building this railroad to nowhere it doesn't make any sense it's costing too much money but somehow as it was built the future sort of took care of itself you know the classic mid 20th century example I always like to cite is Robert Moses who was this some somewhat forgotten figure he was probably the
(19:10) most important person in in New York more powerful than the mayor or the governor of New York City New York State respectively for about a quarter century he started by becoming the parks commissioner he ended up having seventeen different positions in government and he sort of show up with his bulldozer and build parks and levels and neighborhoods and build some highways people could have access to the parks he built all the sort of roadways on Long Island the FDR expressway and there was sort of you know one thing
(19:40) after another that got rebuilt it sort of stopped in the mid 1960s when he planned to build a highway connecting Brooklyn in New Jersey it was going to go through the southern end of Manhattan they're going to sort of raise Greenwich Village to the ground the neighbors sort of objected they started saying we're not quite sure that the future actually is be better than the present there's gonna be this highway with sort of skyscrapers right on top of the highway and and it's sort of it sort of stopped and at that
(20:10) point people basically you know what and once there was no longer a definite view of the future you also ended up with a place where people stopped building things in New York and so it's possible that Moses was very wrong that most of the things were misdirected but it did have this sort of powerful coordinating function and and once the idea of the future disappeared and people no longer believed that there was a future that was that looked very different from the present and that was radically better than the present people
(20:43) stopped being able to build anything and nothing new an infrastructure sense has been built in New York State for close to half a century on any meaningful scale again to sort of illustrate how different past ideas of the future were for those of those those of you familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area there was this thing called the rubber plan up in sort of the late 1940s it was a plan to basically build two large earth and Rockville dams one was between Marin County and Richmond the other between San Francisco and Oakland it was going
(21:22) to turn on the North Bay in the South Bay into two giant freshwater lakes there'd be 20,000 acres of new landfill there's going to be a 32 lane highway built around the entire Bay Area and you have sort of 30 story skyscrapers built around the entire San Francisco Bay you know rubber was sort of a schoolteacher amateur theater producer but in the world of the 1950s this idea was taken seriously enough that you had congressional hearings there was you know a giant mock-up of the plan it was concluded there would be too much of
(21:58) operation and wouldn't quite work and so people sort of gave up on it after a while but again you cannot even imagine someone someone who's a schoolteacher and amateur theater producer being able to have a plan to just re-engineer a huge geographical area like this and and change and change the world in a in a radical way this is again sort of where we're in this world that's extremely different from the world of just 50 or 60 years ago and of course you know all the classic all the classic versions of
(22:38) science fiction cities underwater cities on the moon cities on Mars cities in outer space sort of radically different and very definite ideas of the future that would sort of become self-fulfilling prophecies of one sort or another and when you sort of look at these pictures today these things look they don't look futuristic they look dated they look like they look like they really are sort of from the past which is sort of a against for this very strange way in which things have changed um you know the classic by contrast the
(23:17) classic version of indefinite optimism is a portfolio investing theory it is that you should invest in a in a stock market index that's the way you get the highest risk adjusted returns because the motion of stocks is like the movement of atoms in the universe it's fundamentally random and we can't know anything about it we can just actually we can maybe describe the laws the statistical laws that describe the randomness but what specific stocks or specific companies or specific projects you should invest in you can never know
(23:54) and but you know the stock market generally moves in a in a northeasterly direction and therefore the most important thing is to find the way to get maximum diversification at minimum cost and and do something like a portfolio investing you know in this ship one of the strange things that happens in the shift from definite to indefinite views of the future is that there is this shift from engineering to finance and and and one of the things that happens is that money somehow becomes much more important and so the soundbite
(24:28) version of this is in a definite world money is a means to an end because there are specific things you want to do with money in an indefinite world you have no idea what to do with money and some money simply becomes an end in itself which seems always a little bit perverse you just accumulate money and you have no idea what to do with it that seems for like a bit of a crazy thing to do but I think that's actually what what happens a great deal and so to illustrate one way that this flow might happen if you you know start a
(25:00) successful business you know you sell the company or you sell shares to investors in an IPO you make some money question what do you do with the money you have no idea because nobody knows what to do with anything and so you give the money to a large bank to help you do something what does the bank do it has no idea so it gives the money to a portfolio of institutional investors what do the instance each institutional investor do they have no idea and so they all just invest in a portfolio of stocks not too much in any single stock
(25:36) ever because that suggests you have opinions or you have ideas and that's very dangerous because it suggests that you're somehow not with it and then what do the companies do that get the money they've been told that all they should do is generate free cash flows because if they were to actually invest the money in specific things that would suggest the companies had ideas about the future and that would be very dangerous and so one of the worst things you can ever have is a company that's uh
(26:02) that's not profitable in in in this indefinite world and sort of the the contrarian idea that I always like saying is that we always like investing in companies that are losing money we don't like investing in companies that are making money because the companies that are not profitable are actually the companies that have a lot of ideas about what to do with their money whereas a company that's massively profitable on some level is a company that's out of ideas and it's especially crazy in a world
(26:31) where on where the interest rates are zero and you actually get paid less and less on the money and then of course the companies are profitable to generate cash flows the cash flows eventually go back to people and you sort of cycle and repeat and this is sort of this is the rough flow that happens in the world of indefinite optimism on the problem is you know it's somewhat of a you know this is a bit of an extreme picture but in effect it's a hermetically closed loop and at the end of the day no one's
(27:03) doing anything real with the money it's completely abstracted and what ends up happening is there are fewer and fewer things you can do and and one of the one of the sort of financial ways to illustrate this is if you look at the real interest rates on a 10-year bonds in the US which is this is a measure of how much interest you earn on bonds - what the expected inflation rate is and it's basically been trending steadily downwards today it's at minus 0.
(27:37) 6 percent so 10-year bonds are yielding about 2% the expected inflation for the next decade is 2.6 percent so when you invest in bonds in real terms you're expecting to lose minus 0.6 percent a year for a decade and it shouldn't even be surprising because there's no one in the system who has any idea what to do with the money this has been sort of a consistent critique of the huge deficits the US is running people constantly are saying you know there's a point where the bond market is going to blow up and
(28:09) the interest rates will go higher and one of the really big mysteries is that this has not happened for year after year and I think the the fundamental the fundamental reason this has not happened is that people actually have no idea what to do with the money the last big idea people had on what to do with money that was not sort of circular was to buy houses and to invest in housing and that was sort of the decade the idea of the last decade that idea has gone out of fashion now that people no longer want to buy houses they
(28:41) have absolutely no ideas what to do with money the interest rates the real interest rates are going steadily more negative and so there's some sense in which this system of indefinite optimism is on is gradually sort of running out there's a way in which um you know what the the natural drift is for something from finance to insurance I attend to all I'm not going to give my whole anti Warren Buffett lecture here but I think I think there's a way in which Buffett was prescient and ahead of the curve and
(29:19) basically we oriented most of his businesses towards insurance companies in disguise which is sort of the world of indefinite pessimism and that's what what dominates in that sort of world and we can sort of see how this indeterminacy affects us in very very many different fields so if we look at politics in an indeterminate world the most important position in politics is the pollster and what do you do in politics nobody has a clue but what you do is you take a poll and and the polls tell you what to do they don't really
(29:56) tell you anything on a long-term basis but they sort of tell you incrementally what you do at any any given time and and as we've tracked towards us more and more indeterminate world there's a way in which you know Paul taking has become more and more dominant and so the way we talk about political campaigns and elections is sort of how are people doing in the polls much more than what ideas they're talking it's sort of you know if Martin Luther King were here and said I have a dream about a future
(30:28) that's really different you know the question with how does that poll um it's a it would never and and that's sort of the way we avoid this there obviously are cases where this goes very badly wrong my sort of Exhibit A and my apology to all the Palin fans and the audience here but but but you know people always say it's this incredible mystery why McCain picked Palin in 2008 I think it's not a mystery at all on the basic heuristic was that you you looked at all the Republican senators and governors in 2008
(31:01) Republicans weren't very popular they're mostly running around 40% in the polls Palin was at 85 in Alaska because when oil was $140 a barrel Alaska was like Kuwait everybody was getting huge checks from the government at state of Alaska she was pulling extremely well and so there was no question that you would go with the person who pulled the highest and so you went with you went with Palin even though perhaps it couldn't scale to the US as a whole because the US was not producing way more oil than it was
(31:33) consuming and so you know and then there's sort of our ways in which you know the 2012 re-election gets recast as a contract contest between say nate silver and dick morris silver was a better poll taker and so he won rather than that obama had better ideas or the ideas resonated better or that's what people wanted to hear it's not the substantive way that we talk about politics um to talk about government more generally you know even though government spending is still about the same as it has been for the last 50 or
(32:06) 60 years as a percent of GDP more and more of it is shifted towards transfer payments which are of course a way of saying that the government has no ideas and what to do with money it simply moves it to other people and people it's assumed that people have ideas but you don't have specific ideas of what to do there is a way in which you can see indeterminacy in literature sort of if you sort of take a some you know classic science fiction the 1960s Space Odyssey classic you know the text was updated
(32:38) automatically every hour one could spend entire lifetime doing nothing but X orbing the ever-changing flow of information from a new satellite so a specific definite view of a radically different future which you know maps reasonably closely to today's internet Neuromancer 1984 the sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead Channel future is fundamentally static if you think of it in terms of philosophy there's sort of our different ways to to map these quadrants but I would say the optimistic indeterminate
(33:17) quadrant is fundamentally the quadrant of someone like Rawls or Nozick people only think of them as opposites but they're they're really both in the same category Nozick it's sort of the libertarian version you have no idea what to do and therefore the individual is paramount Rawls you're an avail of ignorance you have no idea what society you will be born in and therefore social democracy is paramount you get two very different ideas but they both take their starting point from sort of complete
(33:48) indeterminacy about the state of the world the classic determinate one you could be on the left you could be on the right but it was there was some sort of sort of Marx Hegel all these people where there was you know even going back to bacon or Locke there was some sort of definite way that things would would get better and you could sort of work towards a better future in one way or another and then of course you have the determinate pessimistic indeterminate pessimistic you think tend to be more classical ones the determinant
(34:22) pessimistic would be like Plato and Aristotle there's a definite way things happen even though there's sort of limits and you can't be too hopeful about technology you're really improving the state of the world in any fundamental way and then probably the classic version of indeterminate pessimism and I think this is sort of the philosophical category that we're back in is sort of the epicurean Lucretia's view of the universe where there is nothing but atoms and the void the atoms randomly move throughout the
(34:50) void they run sometimes bump into each other stuff happens eventually they break apart things fall apart chance roads everything there's nothing specifically you can do that makes any sense everything event you know things sort of all go to pot marijuana farming might be a good thing to go into in this world but basically this is actually this is actually in some ways become the dominant the dominant view and it ends up being sort of strangely stoic because there's really nothing you can do about these larger forces that that will
(35:28) ultimately buffett you in the the most you can hope to achieve the certain amount of equanimity and indifference about fundamental randomness and meaninglessness of the universe you know indeterminacy and death we think about the process of aging and death very differently from the way we used to sort of the classic early science version was that death was a specific problem to be solved there were specific diseases to solve specific ways to conquer death on the contemporary way to think about it is fundamentally through the prism of
(36:06) insurance which is again sort of indeterminate more on the pessimistic side and the main thing we can do is the actuarial math you know what is the probability that you are going to die in a given year if you are that old so if you're 30 years old you have about a 1,000 chance of dying in the next year if you're 80 years old you have a 1 in 10 chance of dying in the next year and and all we can do is sort of describe these these probabilities and I'm not saying that you know by the way that this probabilistic view has nothing to
(36:38) it I just want to sort of illustrate how it sort of dominates our thinking and so instead of trying to find a cure for death or a solution to the problem of aging the best we can hope to do is figure out better ways to calculate the probabilities better ways to give people cell people various life insurance policies and and thereby suggest the sort of pseudo mastery of a process that's fundamentally random and indeterminate of course you know the basic problem is that eventually the luck runs out oops you see how this works
(39:26) so anyway um you know at some point your luck runs out and so I think I think this question of whether you know indeterminate optimism is possible in the long run is this is this core question and is something like this this frame that we've had where it's just one coin toss after another and you know you're probably not going to die in the next hour or the next six months you'll probably be lucky it will probably land heads for the time being but you never think very far about the future is that
(40:06) actually an ultimately stable quadrant or not and so so you know if you want to sort of frame this as a general question it's you could say you know could an iterative process lead if not the best of all possible worlds at least to a world where there's a path of monotonic and potentially never-ending improvement that's sort of a the core idea of this of this world of indeterminate or indefinite optimism on you know the paradigmatic Pro an indeterminate optimist example is Darwin in Darwin's
(40:39) theory of evolution where you know you basically over billions of years develop this proliferation of different life forms and that's sort of the that's the paradigmatic example that we apply to all these different fields and we think that things like that work now I do think there are some paradigmatic counter examples the one that I want to sort of highlight is the paradigmatic counter example of failed in determinism are is failed cities and and you can sort of you can certainly give various examples there's you know Los Angeles
(41:16) which probably should have been the greatest city in the United States with you know fantastic weather and somehow you know everything gradually went wrong with the sprawl LA is still one of the better places in the world you know there's the example of South Paulo I was there for a day about a year ago it's about a 12 mile drive from the main downtown area to the airport it takes about 35 minutes if there's no traffic for hours if there's traffic on the nine lane highways sort of take the helicopter at dusk which is sort of
(41:48) endless lines of red lit cars backed up bumper-to-bumper on it's sort of 30 million people living in enclaves of a quarter to half a million each and of course how Paulo is still you know vastly better than places like Mumbai or Lagos Nigeria or places like that and if you had to sort of give a single reason why the convergence theory of globalization is probably going to fail is that most cities in the developing world looks something like this and and they will not actually be improved in any incremental step-by-step
(42:27) way sorry there's there's no actual incremental way to to improve something something like this and you know if you look at the populations most of the people the world at this point are are living in these sorts of places the the sort of policy debates we have at this point are things like economics versus environmentalism which we we describe as these radically different perspectives on the world but they're really just differing views of different indefinite futures as a sort of maybe economics can
(43:03) be a little bit more optimistic environmentalism is a little bit more pessimistic I personally think that as long as that's the frame environmentalism will always win because indefinite you know optimism is unstable and the ecological critique of economic thinking is that is that the economist says we don't need to think about the environment because people will solve problems every step of the way and then the counter-argument is this this probably does not work but of course the the issue with both is that somehow
(43:36) you're subject to these these much much larger forces it's the market its nature they're fundamentally a sort of random unknowable statistical and and you can't think about them coherently one way or another and of course this kind of approach is also sort of very endemic to the way people think about when they start businesses just to sort of segue back to that and what one sees most commonly are sort of this this methodology where you have no idea what you're doing but it should basically be
(44:13) a never-ending form of a be testing on Darwinistic a be testing might work if you have billions of years but in practice you tend to run out of money well before then and the problem is that somehow the search space of all businesses is much bigger than the search space of great businesses so it's somehow the a/b testing I think generally is a somewhat too inefficient process and the sort of iteration process but you end up with this question you just end up on some very low-hanging hill where the iteration is
(44:49) going to do something that incrementally improves things at every step in time but you maybe you just end up you know in a slightly better part of an infinitely large slum or something like that to use the failed city example there's a machine learning and there's sort of all these different ways where you do not think about the future it's most character strongly characterized I think in a way by the very short time horizons and I think one of the things that's true both on the startup side and
(45:17) that may be even more true on the side of people who invest in startups is that anything that takes longer than a year is considered unreal and fake because we can have no opinions about the future and so everything has to be on a super short time horizon and and and we're sort of dominated by by people who do these kinds of things and there's a question you know how well how well does this actually work and this is this is this is the official religion that we have today and I'm not you know I'm I
(45:54) don't believe in the official religion on but I think you know I think I just want I want people just to at least be aware that is this is the religion that that it's all statistical it's all luck driven and I do think the the most striking thing is that the most successful businesses in some ways don't quite seem to fit this pattern even though you know we we end up talking about it and so you know the you know the you know after the 2007 crash we have seen this return to technology but it was characterized by
(46:35) it was most characterized by businesses that had very definite ideas I think the the iconic one for for the last number of years at least till jobs passed away was Apple which was of course very much the opposite of you know an indeterminate business Apple was one where there was a multi-year vision of the future that was sort of being executed against there are legitimate concerns whether it still has that vision now that jobs is is no longer there but that's really what what is going on and of course that's not really
(47:10) the way we typically talk about it we typically talk about it and we look at you know how mean Jobs was to all the employees and and so we you know they're people I know who are running businesses and they sort of hand out they hound out hand out books describing how bad jobs was to his employees to make their employees feel better about themselves and and so and and I think the the real question you need to ask about something like Apple is you know why did the people put up with this bad behavior and I think it was because it was actually
(47:43) this very countervailing narrative of the future that in a determinate world you know one of the most important metrics is the robustness of the plan what I often call the secret plan that you're working against on you know the the kinds of companies that we've looked at it founders spend over the years the ones that have done best and want been ones that have somehow tracked against this this very very long-term vision of the future and I think sort of the one the one closing thought I would have on
(48:14) this is that on the one most characteristic thing of companies with a plan is that they do not sell and it there often are times that you should sell businesses you know I started PayPal there were reasons that we there were reasons that it was the right decision for us to sell the business when we did in 2002 to eBay but but I do think that the most successful businesses somehow have an idea of the future that's uh that's very different from the present it's not fully valued and and therefore there's
(48:52) there's no point at at which you you should sell I've told this anecdote before but the the most important moment in my mind in the history of Facebook occurred in July of 2006 the company had been around for about two years at the time was still just a college site there may be eight or nine million people on the site the revenues were I think tracking to about thirty million no profits and we got we received an acquisition offer from Yahoo for a billion dollars and so we had the board meeting on Monday morning on in July
(49:35) 2006 or three of us on the board Zuckerberg myself Jim Brier and and you know full disclosure I think that both Breyer and myself on balance thought we probably should take the money and run but but you know Zuckerberg started the meeting and first thing he said was well you know it's kind of a formality we have to have a quick board meeting shouldn't take more than 10 minutes you know we're obviously not going to sell here and then we say well you know which actually talked about this a little bit
(50:10) more you know a billion dollars is a lot of money and we in some ways we hashed the entire the entire discussion we had today here these are like you know you know you own like 25 percent the company there's so much you could do with all the money you'd make well I don't really know what I do with the money I just start another social networking site but I kind of like the one I already have so why should I sell and it was in some way sort of an encapsulation of this of this entire of this entire
(50:44) discussion and of course some you know you never sort of know that the immediate aftermath was that there was you know an almost you know infinite number of not infinite but there was sort of a large number of you know sort of stories about how you know how in the world could you have a CEO who was so crazy that he wouldn't sell the company who didn't know that you should take a billion dollars this is what you got when you had some who's twenty two years old when you didn't have any adults in
(51:16) the company on you know it probably you know it was just the worst decision anybody had ever made the best best rash you know I was a little bit worried about it we had you know the the sort of Founders Fund ideology we had was that we should always back the CEO we should always back the founder and so we went we we just went with with that as a framework but I think sort of the one you know the one partial rationalization I was able to come up with for not taking the money was that I you know we looked at the history in Yahoo it there
(51:49) had been two other companies where they'd offered a billion dollars that had been turned down it was eBay and Google and and so I concluded that give at least you could actually make a pseudo-scientific argument that that that every case was someone had been offered a billion dollars and had rejected it it had been the correct thing to do but I do think this is a but the you know the argument that Zuckerberg finally you know finally finally came came down on was that you know there were all these new things
(52:27) that we were going to build at Facebook and it was clear that Yahoo wasn't valuing any of the products that had not yet been released and he wanted to have a chance to build those products and since he was pretty confident that Yahoo had and this is not anti Yahoo things I think would be true of almost all these companies that they had no definite idea about the future and therefore did not properly value things that did not yet exist they were therefore undervaluing undervaluing the business and I think this is sort of
(53:02) this is sort of the challenge all of us have is to to work towards the future that's not just static like a dead Channel on television but that's a that's a definite future and that is a radically better future that can that can motivate and coordinate and inspire a number of people to change the world and to go to a world where we where where luck is something for us to overcome and to deal with as we as we go along the way but but not for something that becomes this absolute dominating force that that stops all thought
(53:46) thought before it even starts thank you very much and I'm not going to say best of luck thank you you
