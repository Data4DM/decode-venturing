Argues that entrepreneurs and innovators succeed through vision, planning, and execution rather than randomness or iteration alone.      | Uses Elon Musk as an example, citing SpaceX and Tesla as ventures built on deliberate, high-risk, but well-planned strategies.

| **Bill Gurley** | **Late-stage Private Rounds vs. IPOs**         | Critiques late-stage financing trends, arguing that private rounds lack the rigor of IPOs, leading to improper valuation, governance issues, and unproven business models being overfunded.       | Cites Fab.com as an example of a company that burned through $330M without proving its business model. Warns against late-stage investors accepting inflated valuations without scrutiny, which would have been corrected in a rigorous IPO process.                                     | [Link](https://abovethecrowd.com/2015/07/20/todays-100m-late-stage-private-rounds-are-very-different-from-an-ipo/) |
